<h2 class='chapter' id='clink01'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER I—TOM JONAH</a></h2>

<p>“Come here, Tess! Come quick and look at
this poor dog. He’s just drip-ping-<i>wet</i>!”</p>

<p>Dot Kenway stood at a sitting-room window
of the old Corner House, looking out upon Willow
Street. It was a dripping day, and anything or
anybody that remained out-of-doors and exposed
to the downpour for half an hour, was sure to be
saturated.</p>

<p>Nothing wetter or more miserable looking than
the dog in question had come within the range of
the vision of the two younger Corner House girls
that Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Tess, who was older than Dot, came running.
Anything as frightfully despondent and hopeless
looking as that dog was bound to touch the tender
heart of Tess Kenway.</p>

<p>“Let’s—let’s take him to the porch and feed
him, Dot,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Will Ruthie let us?” asked Dot.</p>

<p>“Of course. She’s gone for her music lesson
and won’t know, anyway,” declared Tess, recklessly.</p>

<p>“But maybe Mrs. MacCall won’t like it?”</p>

<p>“She’s upstairs and won’t know, either. Besides,”
Tess said, bolstering up her own desire,
“she says she hasn’t ever sent anybody away
hungry from her door; and that poor dog looks
just as hungry as any tramp that ever came to
the old Corner House.”</p>

<p>The girls ran out of the sitting-room into the
huge front hall which, in itself, was almost big
enough for a ballroom. It was finished in dark,
dark oak; there was a huge front door—like the
door of a castle; the furniture was walnut, upholstered
in haircloth, worn shiny by more than
three generations of use; and out of the middle
of the hall a great stairway arose, dividing when
half-way up into two sections, while a sort of
gallery was built all around the hall at the second
floor, out of which the doors of the principal chambers
opened.</p>

<p>There was a third story above, and above that
a huge garret—often the playroom of the Corner
House girls on such days as this. In the rear
were two wings built on to the house, each three
stories in height. The house had its “long” side
to Willow Street, and only a narrow grass plot
and brick walk separated the sitting-room windows
from the boundary fence.</p>

<p>It faced Main Street, at its head, where the
Parade Ground began. The dripping trees on
the Parade were now in full leaf and the lush
grass beneath them was green. The lawns of the
old Corner House needed the mower, too; and at
the back Uncle Rufus—the general factotum of
the establishment—had laid out a wonderful
kitchen garden which already had yielded radishes
and tender onions and salad, and promised
green peas to accompany the spring lamb to the
table on the approaching Fourth.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot Kenway crossed the big hall of
the Corner House, and went on through the dining-room
with its big table, huge, heavily carved sideboard
and comfortably armed chairs, through the
butler’s pantry into the kitchen. As Tess had
said, Mrs. MacCall, their good-natured and lovable
housekeeper, was not in sight. Nobody delayed
them, and they stepped out upon the half-screened
porch at the back. The woodshed
joined it at the far end. The steps faced Willow
Street.</p>

<p>On the patch of drying green a goat was
tethered, lying down in the rain, reflectively chewing
a cud. He bleated when he saw the girls,
but did not offer to rise; the rain did not disturb
him in the least.</p>

<p>“Billy Bumps likes the rain,” Dot said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The dog outside the gate did not seem to be
enjoying himself. He had dropped down upon
the narrow strip of sward between the flagged
walk and the curbing; his sides heaved as though
he had run a long way, and his pink tongue lolled
out of his mouth and dripped.</p>

<p>“My!” Dot murmured, as she saw this, “the
rain’s soaked right through the poor doggy—hasn’t
it? And it’s just dripping out of him!”</p>

<p>Tess, more practical, if no more earnest in her
desire to relieve the dog’s apparent misery, ran
down to the gate through the falling rain and
called to him:</p>

<p>“Poor, poor doggie! Come in!”</p>

<p>She opened the gate temptingly, but the strange
dog merely wagged his tail and looked at her out
of his beautiful brown eyes. He was a Newfoundland
dog, with a cross of some breed that
gave him patches of deep brown in his coat and
very fine, long, silky hair that curled up at the
ends. He was strongly built and had a good
muzzle which was powdered with the gray hairs
of age.</p>

<p>“Come here, old fellow,” urged Tess, “<i>Do</i>
come in!”</p>

<p>She snapped her fingers and held the gate more
invitingly open. He staggered to his feet and
limped toward her. He did not crouch and slink
along as a dog does that has been beaten; but
he eyed her doubtfully as though not sure, after
all, of this reception.</p>

<p>He was muddied to his flanks, his coat was
matted with green burrs, and there was a piece
of frayed rope knotted about his neck. The dog
followed Tess doubtfully to the porch. Billy
Bumps climbed to his feet and shook his head
threateningly, stamping his feet; but the strange
dog was too exhausted to pay the goat any attention.</p>

<p>The visitor at first refused to mount the steps,
but he looked up at Dot and wagged his tail in
greeting.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tess!” cried the smallest girl. “He
thinks he knows me. Do you suppose we have
ever seen him before?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so,” said Tess, bustling into
the woodshed and out again with a pan of broken
meat that had been put aside for Sandyface and
her children. “I know I should remember him
if I had ever seen him before. Come, old fellow!
Good doggie! Come up and eat.”</p>

<p>She put the pan down on the porch and stood
back from it. The brown eyes of the dog glowed
more brightly. He hesitatingly hobbled up the
steps.</p>

<p>A single sniff of the tidbits in the pan, and the
dog fell to wolfishly, not stopping to chew at all,
but fairly jerking the meat into his throat with
savage snaps.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t gobble so!” gasped Dot. “It—it’s
bad for your indigestions—and isn’t polite, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Guess you wouldn’t be polite if you were as
hungry as he is,” Tess observed.</p>

<p>The dog was so tired that he lay right down,
after a moment, and ate with his nose in the pan.
Dot ventured to pat his wet coat and he thumped
his tail softly on the boards, but did not stop eating.</p>

<p>At this juncture Uncle Rufus came shuffling up
the path from the hen-coop. Uncle Rufus was a
tall, stoop-shouldered, pleasantly brown negro,
with a very bald crown around which was a narrow
growth of tight, grizzled “wool.” He had
a smiling face, and if the whites of his eyes were
turning amber hued with age he was still “purty
pert”—to use his own expression—save when the
rheumatism laid him low.</p>

<p>“Whar’ yo’ chillen done git dat dawg?” he
wanted to know, in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Rufus!” cried Dot. “He came
along looking <i>so</i> wet——”</p>

<p>“And he was <i>so</i> tired and hungry,” added Tess.</p>

<p>“I done spec’ yo’ chillen would take in er
wild taggar, ef one come erlong lookin’ sort o’
meachin’,” grumbled the colored man.</p>

<p>“But he’s so good!” said Tess. “See!” and
she put her hand upon the handsome head of the
bedraggled beast.</p>

<p>“He jes’ er tramp dawg,” said Uncle Rufus,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“He’s only tired and dirty,” said Tess, earnestly.
“I don’t believe he wants to be a tramp.
He doesn’t look at all like the tramps Mrs. MacCall
feeds at the back door here.”</p>

<p>“Nor like those horrid Gypsies that came to
the house the other day,” added Dot eagerly. “I
was afraid of them.”</p>

<p>“Well, it suah ain’t b’long ’round yere—dat
dawg,” muttered Uncle Rufus. “It done run
erway f’om somewhar’ an’ hit trabbel far—ya-as’m!”</p>

<p>He pulled the ears of the big dog himself, in
a kindly fashion, and the dog pounded the porch
harder with his tail and rolled a trusting eye up
at the little group. Evidently the tramp dog was
convinced that this would be a good place to remain
in, and “rest up.”</p>

<p>A pretty girl of twelve or thirteen, with flower-like
face, plump, and her blue eyes dancing and
laughing in spite of her, ran in at the side gate.
She had a covered basket of groceries on her arm,
and was swathed in a raincoat with a close hood
about her face.</p>

<p>“Agnes!” screamed Dot. “See what we’ve
got! Just the nicest, friendfulnest dog——”</p>

<p>“Mercy, Dot! More animals?” was the older
sister’s first comment.</p>

<p>“But he’s such a <i>nice</i> dog,” wailed Dot.</p>

<p>“And so hungry and wet,” added Tess.</p>

<p>“What fine eyes he has!” exclaimed Agnes,
stooping down to pat the noble head. Instantly
the dog’s pink tongue sought her hand and—Agnes
was won!</p>

<p>“He’s splendid! he’s a fine old fellow!” she
cried. “Of course we’ll keep him, Dot.”</p>

<p>“If Ruthie says so,” added Tess, with a loyalty
to the oldest Corner House girl born of the fact
that Ruth had mothered the brood of three
younger sisters since their real mother had died
three years previous.</p>

<p>“I dunno wot yo’ chillen want er dawg for,”
complained Uncle Rufus.</p>

<p>“To keep chicken thieves away,” said Agnes,
promptly, laughing roguishly at the grumbling
black man.</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Tess. “You said yourself, Uncle
Rufus, that those Gypsies that stopped here
might be looking at Ruth’s chickens.”</p>

<p>“Well, I done guess dat tramp dawg knows
when he’s well off,” said the old man, chuckling
suddenly. “He’s layin’ down lak’ he’s fixin’ tuh
stay—ya-as’m!”</p>

<p>The dog had crept to the most sheltered corner
of the porch and curled up on an old rag mat
Mrs. MacCall had left there for the cats.</p>

<p>“He ought to have that dirty old rope taken
off,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>Uncle Rufus drew out his clasp knife and opened
the blade. He approached the weary dog and
knelt down to remove the rope.</p>

<p>“Glo-<i>ree</i>!” he exclaimed, suddenly. “He
done got er collar on him.”</p>

<p>It was hidden in the thick hair about the dog’s
neck. The three girls crowded close to see,
Uncle Rufus unbuckled it and handed the leather
strap to Agnes.</p>

<p>“See if there is any name and address on it,
Aggie!” gasped Tess. “Oh! I hope not. Then,
if we don’t know where he came from, he’s ours
for keeps.”</p>

<p>There was a small brass plate; but no name,
address, or license number was engraved upon it.
Instead, in clear script, it was marked:</p>

<p class='center' style='margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>“THIS IS TOM JONAH. HE IS A</p>
<p class='center' style='margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;'>GENTLEMAN.”</p>

<p>“There!” cried Dot, as though this settled the
controversy. “What did I tell you? He <i>can’t</i>
be any tramp dog. He’s a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“‘Tom Jonah,’” murmured Agnes. “What
a funny name!”</p>

<p>When Ruth came home the younger girls bore
her off at once to see Tom Jonah sleeping comfortably
on the porch. The old dog raised his
grizzled muzzle, wagged his tail, and beamed at
her out of his soft brown eyes.</p>

<p>“The dear love!” cried Tess, clasping her
hands. “Isn’t he beautiful, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Beautifully dirty,” said Ruth, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, but Uncle Rufus says he will wash him
to-morrow. He’s got some insect—insecty-suicide
soap like he puts on the henroosts——”</p>

<p>“Insecticide, Dot,” admonished Tess. “I wish
you wouldn’t try to say words that you <i>can’t</i>
say.”</p>

<p>Dot pouted. But Ruth patted her head and
said, soothingly:</p>

<p>“Never mind, honey. We’ll let the poor dog
stay till he rests up, anyway. He looks like a
kind creature.”</p>

<p>But she, as well as the adults in the old Corner
House, did not expect to see Tom Jonah the next
morning when they awoke. He was allowed to
remain on the porch, and despite the objections of
Sandyface, the mother cat, and the army of
younger felines growing up about her, Tom Jonah
was given a bountiful supper by Mrs. MacCall
herself.</p>

<p>Dot and Tess ran to peep at the dog just before
going to bed that night. He blinked at them
in the lampshine from the open door, and thumped
the porch flooring with his tail.</p>

<p>It was past midnight before anything more was
heard of Tom Jonah. Then the whole house was
aroused—not to say the neighborhood. There
was a savage salvo of barks from the porch, and
down the steps scrambled Tom Jonah. They
heard him go roaring down the yard.</p>

<p>Then there arose a great confusion at the hen
house—a squawking of frightened hens, the loud
“cut, cut, ca-da-cut!” of the rooster, mingling
with which was the voice of at least one human
being and the savage baying of Tom Jonah.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink02'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER II—SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO</a></h2>

<p>Uncle Rufus was too old and too stiff to get
out of bed and down from his third-story room
in the old Corner House, to be of any assistance
at this midnight incident. But the girls were
awakened the moment Tom Jonah began barking.</p>

<p>“It’s a hen thief!” squealed Tess, leaping out
of her own warm nest.</p>

<p>“I hope that dog bites him!” cried Agnes, savagely,
from the other room.</p>

<p>She ran to the window. It was a starlit, but
foggy night. She could see only vaguely the objects
out of doors.</p>

<p>Ruth was scrambling into a skirt and dressing
sacque; she thrust her feet into shoes, too, and
started downstairs. Mrs. MacCall’s window
went up with a bang, and the girls heard the
housekeeper exclaim:</p>

<p>“Shoo! shoo! Get out of there!”</p>

<p>Whoever it was that had roused Tom Jonah,
the person was evidently unable to “get out of
there.” The dog’s threatening growls did not
cease, and the man’s voice which had first been
heard when the trouble started, was protesting.</p>

<p>Agnes followed her older sister downstairs.
Of course, Aunt Sarah Maltby, who slept in one
of the grand front rooms in the main part of the
house, did not even hear all the disturbance.
And there were not any houses really near the
Stower Homestead, which Milton people knew by
the name of “the old Corner House.”</p>

<p>Therefore, the sounds of conflict at the Kenway
hennery were not likely to arouse many people.
But when Ruth and Agnes reached out-of-doors,
the younger girl remembered one person
who might hear and be of assistance.</p>

<p>“Let’s call Neale O’Neil!” she cried to Ruth.
“He’ll help us.”</p>

<p>“We’d better call a policeman,” said Ruth,
running down the brick path.</p>

<p>“Huh! you wouldn’t find a policeman in Milton
at this hour of the night, if you searched for a
week of Sundays,” was the younger girl’s ambiguous
statement. Then she raised her voice and
shouted: “Neale! Neale O’Neil! Help!”</p>

<p>Meantime the dog continued his threatening
bayings. The fowls fluttered and squawked.
Billy Bumps began to blat and butt the partition
in his pen. Whoever had ventured into the hennery
had gotten into hot quarters and no mistake!</p>

<p>Ruth stopped suddenly in the path and clutched
at Agnes’ arm. Agnes was as lightly dressed
as herself; but it was a warm June night and
there was no danger of their getting cold.</p>

older girl gasped in Agnes’ ear. “Maybe—maybe
he’ll tear us to pieces. How savage he
sounds!”</p>

<p>Agnes was frightened; but she had pluck, too.
“Come on, Ruth!” she said. “He is only mad
at the thief.”</p>

<p>“If it <i>is</i> a thief,” quavered Ruth. “I—I am
afraid to go on, Aggie.”</p>

<p>At that moment the sound of little feet pattering
behind them made both girls turn. There
were Dot and Tess, both barefooted, and Dot with
merely a doubled-up comforter snatched from
her bed, wrapped over her night clothes.</p>

<p>“Mercy me, children!” gasped Ruth. “What
are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we mustn’t let Tom Jonah <i>bite</i> that man,”
Tess declared, and kept right on running toward
the henhouse.</p>

<p>“If that dog bites——” screamed Ruth, and
ran after her smaller sister.</p>

<p>There was the big dog leaping savagely toward
the low eaves of the hennery. A kicking figure
was sprawled on the roof, clinging with both
hands to the ridge of it. The girls obtained a
glimpse of a dark face, with flashing teeth, and
big gold rings in the marauder’s ears.</p>

<p>“Tak’ dog away! Tak’ dog away!” the man
said, in a strangled voice.</p>

<p>“He’s one of those Gypsies,” whispered Agnes,
in an awed voice.</p>

<p>A tribe of the nomads in question had passed
through Milton but a day or two before, and the
girls had been frightened by the appearance of
the men of the tribe who had called at the old
Corner House.</p>

<p>Now, whether this marauder belonged to the
same people or not, Ruth saw that he looked like
a Gypsy. For another reason, too, her mind was
relieved at once; Tom Jonah was only savage
toward the man on the roof.</p>

<p>When Tess ran right up to the leaping dog, he
stopped barking, and wagged his tail, as though
satisfied that he had done his duty in drawing
the family to the scene. But he still kept his eyes
on the man, and occasionally uttered a growl deep
in his throat.</p>

<p>“What are you doing up there?” Ruth demanded
of the man.</p>

<p>“Tak’ away dog!” he whined.</p>

<p>“No. I think I will let the dog hold you till a
policeman comes. You were trying to rob our
henroost.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Missee! You wrong. No do that,”
stammered the man.</p>

<p>“What were you doing here, then?”</p>

<p>Before the fellow could manufacture any plausible
tale, a shout came from beyond the back
fence, and somebody was heard to scramble into
the Corner House yard.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, girls?” demanded Neale
O’Neil’s cheerful voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, come here, Neale!” cried Agnes. “Tom
Jonah’s caught a Gypsy.”</p>

<p>“Tom <i>Who</i>?” demanded the tall, pleasant-faced
boy of fifteen, who immediately approached the
henhouse.</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah,” announced Tess. “He’s just
the <i>nicest</i> dog!”</p>

<p>The boy saw the group more clearly then. He
looked from the savagely growling animal to the
man sprawling on the roof, and burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Yes! I guess that fellow up there feels that
the dog is very ‘nice.’ Where did you get the
dog, and where did <i>he</i> get his name?”</p>

<p>“We’ll tell you all about that later, Neale,”
said Ruth, more gravely. “At least, we’ll tell
you all we know about the dear old dog. Isn’t
he a splendid fellow to catch this man at my
hens?”</p>

<p>“And the fellow had some in this bag!” exclaimed
Neale, finding a bag of flopping poultry
at the corner of the hen-run.</p>

<p>“Tak’ away dog!” begged the man on the roof
again.</p>

<p>“That’s all he’s afraid of,” said Agnes. “I
bet he has a knife. Isn’t he a wicked looking fellow?”</p>

<p>“Regular brigand,” agreed Neale. “What we
going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“Give him to a policeman,” suggested Agnes.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose the policeman would <i>want</i>
him?” chuckled Neale. “To awaken a Milton
officer at this hour of the night would be almost
sacrilege, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“What <i>shall</i> we do?” demanded Agnes.</p>

<p>Ruth had been thinking more sensibly for a few
moments. Now she spoke up decisively:</p>

<p>“The man did not manage to do any harm.
Put the poultry back in the house, Neale. If he
ever comes again he will know what to expect.
He thought we had no dog; but he sees we have—and
a savage one. Let him go.”</p>

<p>“Had we better do that, sister?” whispered
Agnes. “Oughtn’t he to be punished?”</p>

<p>“I expect so,” Ruth said, grimly. “But for
once I am going to shirk my duty. We’ll take
away the dog and let him go.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll take him away?” demanded Agnes,
suddenly.</p>

<p>Neale had taken the sack in which the fowl
struggled, to the door of the henhouse, opened
it, and dumped the fowl out. Tom Jonah evidently
recognized him for a friend, for he wagged
his tail, but still kept his eye on the man upon
the roof.</p>

<p>“I declare!” said Ruth. “I hadn’t thought.
Whom will he mind?”</p>

<p>“Come here, Tom Jonah!” said Neale, snapping
his fingers.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah still wagged his tail, but he remained
ready to receive the Gypsy (if such the
fellow was) in his jaws, if he descended.</p>

<p>“Come away, Tom!” exclaimed Agnes, confidently.
“Come on back to the house.”</p>

<p>The man on the roof moved and Tom Jonah
stiffened. He refused to budge.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to call a cop after all,”
said Neale, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Here, sir!” commanded Ruth. “Come away.
You have done enough——”</p>

<p>But the dog did not think so. He held his
place and growled.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re bound to stay up there, till daylight—or
a policeman—doth appear, my friend,”
called up Neale to the besieged.</p>

<p>“Tak’ away dog!” begged the frightened fellow.</p>

<p>“Why, Tom Jonah!” exclaimed Tess, walking
up to the big dog and putting a hand on his collar.
“You must come away when you are spoken
to. You’ve caught the bad man, and that’s
enough.”</p>

<p>Tom Jonah turned and licked her hand. Then
he moved a few steps away with her and looked
back.</p>

<p>“Come on with me, Tom Jonah,” commanded
the little girl, firmly. “Let the bad man go.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about <i>that</i>?” demanded
Neale.</p>

<p>The next minute the fellow had scrambled up
the roof, caught the low hanging limb of a shade
tree that stood near the fence, and swinging himself
like a cat into the tree, he got out on another
branch that overhung the sidewalk, dropped, and
ran.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah sprang to the fence with a savage
bay; but the man only went the faster. The incident
was closed in a minute, and the little
party of half-dressed young folk went back to
their beds, while the strange dog curled up on
his mat in the corner of the porch again and slept
the sleep of the just till morning.</p>

<p>And now that the excitement is over, let us
find out a little something about the Corner House
girls, their friends, their condition in life, and
certain interesting facts regarding them.</p>

<p>When Mr. Howbridge, the lawyer from Milton
and Uncle Peter Stower’s man of affairs and the
administrator of his estate, came to the little tenement
on Essex Street, Bloomingsburg, where the
four orphaned Kenway girls had lived for some
years with Aunt Sarah Maltby, he first met Tess
and Dot returning from the drugstore with Aunt
Sarah’s weekly supply of peppermint drops.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah had been a burden on the Kenways
for many years. The girls had only their
father’s pension to get along on. Aunt Sarah
claimed that when Uncle Peter died, his great
estate would naturally fall to her, and then she
would return all the benefits she had received
from the Kenway family.</p>

<p>But the lawyer knew that queer old Uncle
Peter Stower had made a will leaving practically
all his property to the four girls in trust, and to
Aunt Sarah only a small legacy. But this will
had been hidden somewhere by the old man before
his recent death and had not yet been found.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no other claimants to the
Stower Estate, however, and the court allowed
Mr. Howbridge to take the Kenway girls and
Aunt Sarah to Milton and establish them in the
Stower Homestead, known far and wide as the
old Corner House.</p>

<p>Here, during the year that had passed, many
interesting and exciting things had happened to
Ruth and Agnes and Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>Ruth was the head of the family, and the lawyer
greatly admired her good sense and ability. She
was not a strikingly pretty girl, for she had
“stringy” black hair and little color; but her
eyes were big and brown, and those eyes, and her
mouth, laughed suddenly at you and gave expression
to her whole face. She was now completing
her seventeenth year.</p>

<p>Agnes was thirteen, a jolly, roly-poly girl, who
was fond of jokes, a bit of a tomboy, up to all
sorts of pranks—who laughed easily and cried
stormily—had “lots of molasses colored hair”
as she said herself, and was the possessor of a pair
of blue eyes that could stare a rude boy out of
countenance, but who <i>would</i> spoil the effect of
this the next instant by giggling; a girl who had
a soulmate among her girl friends all of the time,
but not frequently did one last for long in the
catalog of her “best friends.”</p>

<p>Nobody remembered that Tess had been named
Theresa. She was a wise little ten-year-old who
possessed some of Ruth’s dignity and some of
Agnes’ prettiness, and the most tender heart in
the world, which made her naturally tactful.
She was quick at her books and very courageous.</p>

<p>Dorothy, or Dot, was the baby and pet of the
family. She was a little brunette fairy; and if
she was not very wise as yet, she was faithful and
lovable, and not one of “the Corner House girls,”
as the Kenways were soon called by Milton people,
was more beloved than Dot.</p>

<p>The girls’ best boy friend lived with the old
cobbler, Mr. Con Murphy, on the rear street, and
in a little house the yard of which adjoined the
larger grounds of the old Corner House. We
have seen how quickly Neale O’Neil came to the
assistance of the Kenway girls when they were
in trouble.</p>

<p>Neale had been brought up among circus people,
his mother having traveled all her life with
Twomley &amp; Sorber’s Herculean Circus and Menagerie.
The boy’s desire for an education and
to win a better place in the world for himself,
had caused him to run away from his uncle, Mr.
Sorber, and support himself in Milton while he
attended school.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls had befriended Neale
and when his uncle finally searched him out and
found the boy, it was they who influenced the
man against taking Neale away. Neale had
proved himself an excellent scholar and had made
friends in Milton; now he was about to graduate
with Agnes from the highest grammar grade to
high school.</p>

<p>The particulars of all these happenings have
been related in the first two volumes of the series,
entitled respectively, “The Corner House Girls”
and “The Corner House Girls at School.”</p>

<p>When Agnes woke up in the morning following
the unsuccessful raid of the Gypsy man on the
hennery, she had something of wonderful importance
to tell Ruth. She had seen her “particular
friend,” Trix Severn, on the street Saturday
afternoon and Trix had told her something.</p>

<p>“You’ve heard the girls talking about Pleasant
Cove, Ruthie?” said Agnes, earnestly. “You
know Mr. Terrence Severn owns one of the big
hotels there?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Trix talks enough about it,” said
the older Kenway girl.</p>

<p>“Oh! you don’t like Trix——”</p>

<p>“I’m not exceedingly fond of her. And there
was a time when you thought her your very deadliest
enemy,” laughed Ruth.</p>

<p>“Well! Trix has changed,” declared the unsuspicious
Agnes, “and she’s proposed the very
nicest thing, Ruth. She says her mother and
father will let her bring all four of us to the Cove
for the first fortnight after graduation. The
hotel will not be full then, and we will be Trix’s
guests. And we’ll have loads of fun.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know——” began Ruth, but Agnes
broke in warmly:</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you say ‘No,’ Ruthie Kenway!
Don’t you say ‘No!’ I’ve just made up my mind
to go to Pleasant Cove——”</p>

<p>“No need of flying off, Ag,” said Ruth, in the
cool tone that usually brought Agnes “down to
earth again.” “We have talked of going there
for a part of the summer. A change to salt air
will be beneficial for us all—so Dr. Forsythe says.
I have talked to Mr. Howbridge, and he says
‘Yes.’”</p>

<p>“Well, then!”</p>

<p>“But I doubt the advisability of accepting Trix
Severn’s invitation.”</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that mean——”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses,” again advised Ruth. “We
will go, anyway. If all is well we will stay at the
hotel a while. Pearl Harrod’s uncle owns a
bungalow there, too; <i>she</i> has asked me to come
there for a while, and bring you all.”</p>

<p>“Well! isn’t that nice?” agreed Agnes. “Then
we can stay twice as long.”</p>

<p>“Whether it will be right for us to accept the
hospitality offered us when we have no means
of returning it——”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, Ruth! don’t be a fuss-cat.”</p>

<p>“There is a big tent colony there—quite removed
from the hotel,” suggested Ruth. “Many
of our friends and their folks are going <i>there</i>.
Neale O’Neil is going with a party of the boys
for at least two weeks.”</p>

<p>“Say! we’ll have scrumptious times,” cried
Agnes, with sparkling eyes. Her anticipation of
every joy in life added immensely to the joy itself.</p>

<p>“Yes—if we go,” said Ruth, slowly. But it
was something for the others to look forward to
with much pleasure.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink03'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER III—THE DANCE AT CARRIE POOLE’S</a></h2>

<p>Tess and Dot Kenway had something of particular
interest to hold their attention, too, the
minute they awoke on this Sunday morning. Dot
voiced the matter first when she asked:</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that dear Tom Jonah is here
yet, Tess?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope so!” cried the older girl.</p>

<p>“Let’s run see,” suggested Dot, and nothing
loth Tess slipped into her bathrobe and slippers,
too, and the two girls pattered downstairs.
Their baths, always overseen by Ruth, were neglected.
They must see, they thought, if the good
old dog was on the porch.</p>

<p>Nobody was astir downstairs; Mrs. MacCall
had not yet left her room, and on Sunday mornings
even Uncle Rufus allowed himself an extra
hour in bed. There was the delicious smell of
warm baked beans left over night in the range
oven; the big, steaming pot would be set upon the
table at breakfast, flanked with golden-brown
muffins on one side and the sliced “loaf,” or
brownbread, on the other.</p>

<p>Sandyface came yawning from her basket
behind the stove when Tess and Dot entered the
kitchen. She had four little black and white blind
babies in that basket which she had found in a
barrel in the woodshed only a few days before.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacCall said she did not know what was
to be done with the four kittens. Sandyface’s
original family was quite grown up, and if these
four were allowed to live, too, that would make
nine cats around the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“And the goodness knows!” exclaimed the
housekeeper, “that’s a whole lot more than any
family has a business to keep. We’re overrun
with cats.”</p>

<p>Tess unlocked the door and she and Dot went
out on the porch, Sandyface following. There
was no sign of the big dog.</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah’s gone!” sighed Dot, quaveringly.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t have thought it—when we treated
him so nicely,” said Tess.</p>

<p>Sandyface sniffed suspiciously at the old mat
on which the dog had lain. Then she looked all
about before venturing off the porch.</p>

<p>The sunshine and quiet of a perfect Sunday
morning lay all about the old Corner House.
Robins sought their very souls for music to tell
how happy they were, in the tops of the cherry
trees. Catbirds had not yet lost their love songs
of the spring; though occasionally one scolded
harshly when a roaming cat came too near the
hidden nest.</p>

<p>Wrens hopped about the path, and even upon
the porch steps, secure in their knowledge that
they were too quick for Sandyface to reach, and
with unbounded faith in human beings. An oriole
burst into melody, swinging in the great snowball
bush near the Willow Street fence.</p>

<p>There was a moist, warm smell from the garden;
the old rooster crowed raucously; Billy
Bumps bleated a wistful “Good-morning” from
his pen. Then came a scramble of padded feet,
and Sandyface went up the nearest tree like a
flash of lightning.</p>

<p>“Here is Tom Jonah!” cried Tess, with delight.</p>

<p>From around the corner of the woodshed appeared
the big, shaggy dog. He cocked one ear
and actually smiled when he saw the cat go up
the tree. But he trotted right up on the porch to
meet the delighted girls.</p>

<p>His brown eyes were deep pools where golden
sparks played. The mud had been mostly shaken
off his flanks and paws. He was rested, and he
acted as though he were sure of his position here
at the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“Good old fellow!” cried Tess, putting out a
hand to pat him.</p>

<p>At once Tom Jonah put up his right paw to
shake hands. He repeated the feat with Dot the
next moment, to the delight of both girls.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dot, “he’s a trick dog.”</p>

<p>“He’s just what his collar says; he’s a
gentleman,” sighed Tess, happily. “Oh! I hope his
folks won’t ever come after him.”</p>

<p>Ruth had to come down for Tess and Dot or
they would not have been bathed and dressed in
time for breakfast. The smaller girls were very
much taken with Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>They found that he had more accomplishments
than “shaking hands.” When Agnes came down
and heard about his first manifestation of education,
she tried him at other “stunts.”</p>

<p>He sat up at the word of command. He would
hold a bit of meat, or a sweet cracker, on his nose
any length of time you might name, and never
offer to eat it until you said, “Now, sir!” or something
of the kind. Then Tom Jonah would jerk
the tidbit into the air and catch it in his jaws as
it came down.</p>

<p>And those jaws! Powerful indeed, despite
some of the teeth having been broken and discolored
by age. For Tom Jonah was no puppy.
Uncle Rufus declared him to be at least twelve
years old, and perhaps more than that.</p>

<p>But he had the physique of a lion—a great,
broad chest, and muscles in his shoulders that
slipped under the skin when he was in action like
a tiger’s. Now that he was somewhat rested
from the long journey he had evidently taken, he
seemed a very powerful, healthy dog.</p>

<p>“And he would have eaten that tramp up, if
he’d gotten hold of him,” Agnes declared, as they
gathered at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Aggie; I don’t think Tom Jonah would
really have <i>bitten</i> that Gypsy man,” Tess hastened
to say. “But he might have grabbed his
coat and held on.”</p>

<p>“With those jaws—I guess he would have held
on,” sighed Agnes.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said Dot, “he saved Ruthie’s hens.
Didn’t he, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“I’ll gladly pay his license fee if he wants to
stay with us,” said Ruth, gaily.</p>

<p>The cornmeal muffins chanced to be a little
over-baked that morning; at least, one panful
was. Dot did not like “crusts”; she had been
known to hide very hard ones under the edge of
her plate.</p>

<p>She played with one of these muffin crusts more
than she ate it, and Aunt Sarah Maltby (who was
a very grim lady indeed with penetrating eyes
and a habit of seldom speaking) had an accusing
eye upon the little girl.</p>

<p>“Dorothy,” she said, suddenly, “you will see
the time, I have no doubt, when you will be
hungry for that crust. You had better eat it now
like a nice girl.”</p>

<p>“Aunt Sarah, I really do not want it,” said
Dot, gravely. “And—and if I don’t, do you
think I shall really some day be hungry for just
<i>this</i> pertic’lar crust?”</p>

<p>“You will. I expect nothing less,” snapped
Aunt Sarah. “The Kenways was allus
spend-thrifts. Why! when I was your age, Dorothy, I
was glad to get dry bread to eat!”</p>

<p>Dot looked at her with serious interest. “You
must have been awfully poor, Aunt Sarah,” she
said, sympathetically. “You have a much better
time living with us, don’t you?”</p>

<p>Ruth shook her head admonishingly at the
smallest girl; but for once Aunt Sarah was rather
nonplussed, and nobody heard her speak again
before she went off to church.</p>

<p>Neale came over later, dressed for Sunday
school, and he was as much interested in the new
boarder at the Corner House as the girls themselves.</p>

<p>“If he belongs anywhere around Milton, somebody
will surely know about him,” said the boy.
“I’ll make inquiries. Wherever he comes from,
he must be well known in that locality.”</p>

<p>“Why so?” demanded Agnes.</p>

<p>“Because of what it says on his collar,”
laughed Neale O’Neil.</p>

<p>“Because of what it <i>doesn’t</i> say, I guess,” explained
Ruth, seeing her sister’s puzzled face.
“There is no name of owner, or license number.
Do you see?”</p>

<p>“It—it would be an insult to license a dog like
Tom Jonah,” sputtered Tess. “Just—just like
a tag on an automobile!”</p>

<p>“Yo’ right, honey,” chuckled Uncle Rufus.
“He done seem like folkses—don’ he? I’se gwine
tuh give him a reg’lar barf an’ cure up dem sore
feetses ob his. He’ll be anudder dawg—sho’
will!”</p>

<p>The old man took Tom Jonah to the grass plot
near the garden hydrant, and soaped him well—with
the “insect-suicide” soap Dot had talked
about—and afterward washed him down with the
hose. Tom Jonah stood for it all; he had evidently
been used to having his toilet attended to.</p>

<p>When the girls came home from Sunday school,
they found him lying on the porch, all warm and
dried and his hair “fluffy.” They had asked
everybody they met—almost—about Tom Jonah;
but not a soul knew anything regarding him.</p>

<p>“He’s going to be ours for keeps! He’s going
to be ours for keeps!” sang Tess, with delight.</p>

<p>Sandyface’s earlier family—Spotty, Almira,
Bungle and Popocatepetl—had taken a good look
at the big dog, and then backed away with swelling
tails and muffled objections. But the old
cat had to attend to the four little blind mites behind
the kitchen range, so she had grown familiar
enough with Tom Jonah to pass him on her
way to and from the kitchen door.</p>

<p>He was too much of a gentleman, as his collar
proclaimed, to pay her the least attention save
for a friendly wag of his bushy tail. To the four
half-grown cats he gave little heed. But Tess
and Dot thought that he ought to become acquainted
with the un-named kittens in the basket
immediately.</p>

<p>“If they get used to him, you know,” said Tess,
“they’ll all live together just like a ‘happy
family.’”</p>

<p>“Like <i>us</i>?” suggested Dot, who did not quite
understand the reference, having forgotten the
particular cage thus labeled in the circus they
had seen the previous summer.</p>

<p>“Why! of course like us!” laughed Tess, and
Sandyface being away foraging for her brood,
Tess seized the basket and carried it out on the
porch, setting it down before Tom Jonah who
was lying in the sun.</p>

<p>The big dog sniffed at the basket but did not
offer to disturb the sleeping kittens. That would
not do for the curious girls. They had to delve
deeper into the natural lack of affinity between
the canine and the feline families.</p>

<p>So Tess lifted one little black and white,
squirmy kitten—just as its mother did, by the
back of its neck—and set it upon the porch before
the dog’s nose. The kitten became awake instantly.
Blind as it was, it stiffened its spine
into an arch, backed away from the vicinity of the
dog precipitately, and “spit” like a tiny teakettle
boiling over.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! the horrid thing,” wailed Dot. “And
poor Tom Jonah didn’t do a thing to it!”</p>

<p>“But see him!” gasped Tess, in a gale of giggles.</p>

<p>For really, Tom Jonah looked too funny for
anything. He turned away his head with a most
embarrassed expression of countenance and
would not look again at the spitting little animal.
He evidently felt himself in a most ridiculous
position and finally got up and went off the porch
altogether until the girls returned the basket of
kittens to its proper place behind the stove.</p>

<p>At dinner that Sunday, when Uncle Rufus
served the roast, he held the swinging door open
until Tom Jonah paced in behind him into the
dining-room. Seeing the roast placed before
Mrs. MacCall, Tom Jonah sat down beside her
chair in a good position to observe the feast; but
waited his turn in a most gentlemanly manner.</p>

<p>Mrs. MacCall cut some meat for him and put
it on a plate. This Uncle Rufus put before Tom
Jonah; but the big dog did not offer to eat it
until he was given permission. And now he no
longer “gobbled,” but ate daintily, and sat back
when he was finished like any well-bred person,
waiting for the next course.</p>

<p>Even Aunt Sarah looked with approval upon
the new acquisition to the family of the old Corner
House. She had heard the tale of his rescue
of Ruth’s poultry from the marauding Gypsy,
and patted Tom Jonah’s noble head.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing to have a watch-dog on the
premises,” she said, “with all that old silver and
trash you girls insist upon keeping out of the
plate-safe. Your Uncle Peter would turn in his
grave if he knew how common you was makin’ the
Stower plate.”</p>

<p>“But what is the good of having a thing if you
don’t make use of it?” queried Ruth, stoutly.</p>

<p>Ruth was a girl with a mind of her own, and
not even the carping criticisms of Aunt Sarah
could turn her from her course if once she was
convinced that what she did was right. Nor was
she frightened by her schoolmates’ opinions—as
note her friendship with Rosa Wildwood.</p>

<p>Bob Wildwood was a “character” in Milton.
People smiled at him and forgave his peculiarities
to a degree; but they could not respect him.</p>

<p>In the first place, Bob was a Southerner—and
a Southerner in a New England town is just as
likely to be misunderstood, as a Northerner in
a Georgian town.</p>

<p>Bob and his daughter, Rosa, had drifted to
Milton a couple of years previous. They had
been “drifting” for most of the girl’s short life;
but now Rosa was quite big enough to have some
influence with her shiftless father, and they
had taken some sort of root in the harsh New
England soil, so different from their own rich
bottom-lands of the South.</p>

<p>Besides, Rosa was in ill health. She was
“weakly”; Bob spoke of her as having “a mis’ry
in her chest.” Dr. Forsythe found that the girl
had weak lungs, but he was sane and old-fashioned
enough to scout the idea that she was in
danger of becoming a victim of tuberculosis.</p>

<p>“If you go to work, Bob, and earn for her
decent food and a warm shelter, she will pull
through and get as hearty and strong as our
Northern girls,” declared the doctor, sternly.
“You say you lost her twin two years ago——”</p>

<p>“But I didn’t done los’ Juniper by no sickness,”
muttered Bob, shaking his head.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls thought Bob Wildwood
a most amusing man, for he talked just like a
darky (to their ears); but Uncle Rufus shook his
head in scorn at Wildwood. “He’s jes’ no-’count
white trash,” the old colored man observed.</p>

<p>However, spurred by the doctor’s threat, Bob
let drink alone for the most part, and went to
work for Rosa, his remaining daughter, who was
just Ruth’s age and was in her class at High—when
she was well enough to get there. In spite
of her blood and bringing up, Rosa Wildwood had
a quick and retentive mind and stood well in her
classes.</p>

<p>Bob became a coal-heaver. He worked for
Lovell &amp; Malmsey. He drove a pair of mules
without lines, ordering them about in a most wonderful
manner in a tongue entirely strange to
Northern teamsters; and he was black with coal-dust
from week-end to week-end. Ruth said there
only was one visible white part of Rosa’s father;
that was the whites of his eyes.</p>

<p>The man must have loved his daughter very
much, however; for it was his nature to be shiftless.
He would have gone hungry and ragged
himself rather than work. He now kept steadily
at his job for Rosa’s sake.</p>

<p>On Monday Rosa was not at school, and coming
home to luncheon at noon, Ruth ran half a
block out of her way to find out what was the
matter. Not alone was the tenement the Wildwoods
occupied a very poor one, but Rosa was no
housekeeper. It almost disgusted the precise
and prim Ruth Kenway to go into the three-room
tenement.</p>

<p>Rosa had a cold, and of course it had settled
on her chest. She was just dragging herself
around to get something hot for Bob’s dinner.
Ruth made her go back to bed, and she finished
the preparations.</p>

<p>When she came to make the tea, the Corner
House girl was horrified to observe that the metal
teapot had probably not been thoroughly washed
out since the day the Wildwoods had taken up
their abode in Milton.</p>

<p>“Paw likes to have the tea set back on the
stove,” drawled Rosa, with her pleasant Southern
accent. “When he gets a chance, he runs in
and ‘takes a swig,’ as he calls it, out of the pot.
He says it’s good for the gnawin’ in his stomach—it
braces him up an’ is <i>so</i> much better than
when he useter mix toddies,” said the girl, gratefully.
“We’d have had June with us yet, if it
hadn’t been for paw’s toddies.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Ruth, startled. “I thought your
sister June died?”</p>

<p>Rosa shook her head and the tears flowed into
her soft eyes. “Oh, no. She went away. She
couldn’t stand the toddies no more, she said—and
her slavin’ to keep the house nice, and us
movin’ on all the time. June was housekeeper—she
was a long sight smarter’n me, Ruth.”</p>

<p>“But the teachers at school think you are
awfully smart,” declared the Corner House girl.</p>

<p>“June warn’t so smart at her books,” said
Rosa. “But she could do <i>anything</i> with her
hands. You’d thunk she was two years older’n
me, too. She was dark and handsome. She got
mad, and run away, and then we started lookin’
for her; but we’ve never found her yet,” sighed
Rosa. “And now I’ve got so miserable that I
can’t keep traveling with paw. So we got to stop
here, and maybe we won’t ever see June again.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I hope you will,” cried Ruth. “Now,
your father’s dinner is all ready to dish up. And
I’ll come back after school this afternoon and rid
up the house for you; don’t you do a thing.”</p>

<p>Ruth had time that noon for only a bite at home,
and explained to Mrs. MacCall that she would be
late in returning from school. She carried a
voluminous apron with her to cover her school
frock when she set about “ridding up” the Wildwood
domicile.</p>

<p>Ruth wanted to help Rosa; she hoped Rosa
would keep up with the class and be promoted at
the end of the term, as she was sure to be herself.
And she was sorry for sooty, odd-talking Bob
Wildwood.</p>

<p>What Rosa had said about her lost twin sister
had deeply interested Ruth Kenway. She
wanted, too, to ask the Southern girl about
“June,” or Juniper.</p>

<p>“We were the last children maw had,” said
Rosa. “She just seemed to give up after we were
born. The others were all sickly—just drooped
and faded. And they all were girls and had
flower names. Maw was right fanciful, I reckon.</p>

<p>“I wish June had held on. She’d stuck it out,
I know, if she’d believed paw could stop drinking
toddies. But, you see he <i>has</i>. He ‘swigs’ an
awful lot of tea, though, and I expect it’s tanning
him inside just like he was leather!”</p>

<p>Ruth really thought this was probable—especially
with the teapot in the condition she had
found it. But she had put some washing soda in
the pot, filled it with boiling water, and set it
back on the stove to stew some of the “tannin”
out of it.</p>

<p>While the Corner House girl was talking with
Rosa in the little bedroom the girl called her own,
Bob brought his mules to a halt before the house
with an empty wagon, and ran in as usual.</p>

<p>The girls heard him enter the outer room; but
Ruth never thought of what the man’s object
might be until Rosa laughed and said:</p>

<p>“There’s paw now, for a swig at the teapot.
I hope you left it full fo’ him, Ruthie, dear.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness mercy me!” cried the Corner
House girl, and darted out to the kitchen to warn
the man.</p>

<p>But she was too late. Already the begrimed
Bob Wildwood had the spout of the teapot to
his lips and several swallows of the scalding and
acrid mixture gurgled down his throat before he
discovered that it was not tea!</p>

<p>“Woof! woof! woof!” he sputtered, and flung
pot and all away from him. “Who done tryin’
poison me! Woof! I’s scalded with poison!”</p>

<p>He coughed and spluttered over the sink, and
then tried a draught of cold water from the spigot—which
probably did him just as much good as
anything.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, Mr. Wildwood!” gasped Ruth,
standing with clasped hands and looking at the
sooty man, half frightened. “I—I was just boiling
the teapot out.”</p>

<p>“Boilin’ it out?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. With soda. I—I——It won’t
poison you, I guess.”</p>

<p>“My Lawd!” groaned Bob. “What won’t yo’
Northerners do nex’? Wash out er teapot!”
and he grumblingly went forth to his team and
drove away.</p>

<p>Ruth felt that her good intentions were misunderstood—to
a degree. But Rosa thanked her
very prettily for what she had done, and the next
day she was able to come to school again.</p>

<p>It was only a few days later that Carrie Poole
invited a number of the high school girls and
boys—and some of the younger set—to the last
dance of the season at her home. She lived in a
huge old farmhouse, some distance out of town
on the Buckshot road, and the Corner House
girls and Neale O’Neil had spent several pleasant
evenings there during the winter and spring.</p>

<p>The night before this party there was a big
wind, and a part of one of the chimneys came
down into the side yard during the night with
a noise like thunder; so Ruth had to telephone for
a mason before breakfast.</p>

<p>Had it not been for this happening, the Corner
House girls—at least, Ruth and Agnes—and
Neale O’Neil, would have escaped rather an embarrassing
incident at the party.</p>

<p>Neale came over to supper the evening of the
party, and he brought his pumps in a newspaper
under his arm.</p>

<p>“Come on, girls, let’s have your dancing slippers,”
he said to the two older Corner House
girls, who were going to the dance. “I’ll put
them with mine.”</p>

<p>And he did so—rolling the girls’ pretty slippers
up in the same parcel with his own. He
left the parcel in the kitchen. Later it was discovered
that the mason’s helper had left a similarly
wrapped parcel there, too.</p>

<p>When the three young folk started off, it was
Agnes who ran back after the bundle of dancing
slippers. Neale carried it under his arm, and
they walked briskly out through the suburbs of
Milton and on along the Buckshot road.</p>

<p>“Are you really going to Pleasant Cove this
summer, Neale?” demanded Agnes, as they went
on together.</p>

<p>“If I can. Joe has asked me. And you
girls?”</p>

<p>“Trix says we must come to her father’s hotel
for two weeks at least,” Agnes declared.</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Neale, doubtfully. “Are you
going, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” admitted the older Corner
House girl.</p>

<p>“Now, isn’t that just too mean?” complained
Agnes. “You just say that because you don’t
like Trix.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether Trix will be of the same
mind when the time comes,” said Ruth, firmly.</p>

<p>“I believe you,” grunted Neale.</p>

<p>Agnes pouted. “It’s just mean of you,” she
said. “Of course she will want us to go.”
While Agnes was “spoons” with a girl, she was
always strictly loyal to her. She could not possibly
see Trix Severn’s faults just now.</p>

<p>They arrived at the farmhouse and found a
crowd already assembled. There was a great
deal of talking and laughter, and while Neale
stood chatting with some of the boys in the hall,
Ruth and Agnes came to him for their slippers.</p>

<p>“Sure!” said the boy, producing the newspaper-wrapped
bundle he carried. “Guess I’ll put on
my own pumps, too.”</p>

<p>He unrolled the parcel. Then a yell of derision
and laughter arose from the onlookers; instead of
three pairs of dancing slippers, Neale produced
two pairs of half-worn and lime-bespattered shoes
belonging to the masons who had repaired the
old Corner House chimney!</p>

<p>“Now we can’t dance!” wailed Agnes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neale!” gasped Ruth, while the young
folk about them went off into another gale of
laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, it wasn’t my fault,” grumbled Neale.
“Aggie went after the bundle.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t have left them right there with the
masons’ bundle—so now!” snapped Agnes.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink04'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IV—THE MYSTERY OF JUNE WILDWOOD</a></h2>

<p>Now, Trix Severn had maneuvered so as to get
the very first dance with Neale O’Neil. Among
all the boys who attended the upper grammar
grades, and the High, of Milton, the boy who had
been brought up in a circus was the best dancer.
The older girls all were glad to get him for a
partner.</p>

<p>Time had been when Trix sneered at “that
circus boy,” but that was before he and the two
older Corner House girls had saved Trix from
a collapsing snow palace back in mid-winter.</p>

<p>Since that time she had taken up with Agnes
Kenway as her very closest chum, and she had
visited the old Corner House a good deal. When
Agnes and her sister arrived at the party on this
evening, with Neale as escort, Trix determined
to have at least <i>one</i> dance with the popular boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neale!” she whispered, fluttering up to
him in her very nicest way, “Ruth and Agnes will
be half an hour primping, upstairs. The music
is going to strike up. Do let <i>us</i> have the first
dance.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Neale, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>It was the moment later that the discovery was
made of the masons’ shoes in the bundle he carried
under his arm.</p>

<p>“Now we can’t dance,” repeated Agnes, when
the laughter had somewhat subsided.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neale can dance just as well,” Trix said,
carelessly. “Come on, Neale! You know this is
<i>our</i> dance.”</p>

<p>Of course Neale could dance in his walking
shoes. But he saw Agnes’ woebegone face and
he hesitated.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Aggie,” he said. “If it wasn’t
so far——”</p>

<p>“Why, Neale O’Neill” snapped Trix, unwisely.
“You don’t mean to say you’d be foolish enough
to go clear back to the Corner House for those
girls’ slippers?”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was just this opposition that was
needed to start Neale off. He pulled his cap
from his pocket and turned toward the door, with
a shrug. “I guess I can get back in an hour,
Ag. Don’t you and Ruth dance much in your
heavy shoes until then. You’ll tire yourselves all
out.”</p>

<p>“Why, Neale O’Neill” cried Trix. “You
won’t do it?”</p>

<p>Even Ruth murmured against the boy’s making
the trip for the slippers. “We can get along,
Neale,” she said, in her quiet way.</p>

<p>“And you promised to dance with me this first
dance,” declared Trix, angrily, as the music began.</p>

<p>Neale did not pay much attention to her—at the
moment. “It’s my fault, I guess,” he said,
laughing. “I’ll go back for them, Ag.”</p>

<p>But Trix got right between him and the door.
“Now! you sha’n’t go off and leave me in the
lurch that way, Neale O’Neill” she cried, shrilly.</p>

<p>“Aw——There are other dances. Wait till I
come back,” he said.</p>

<p>“You can dance in the shoes you have on,”
Trix said, sharply.</p>

<p>“What if?”</p>

<p>“But <i>we</i> can’t, Trix,” interposed Agnes, much
distressed. “Ruth and I, you know——”</p>

<p>“I don’t care!” interrupted Trix, boiling over
at last. “You Corner House girls are the most
selfish things! You’d spoil his fun for half the
party——”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t bother!” growled Neale, in much
disgust.</p>

<p>“I will bother! You——”</p>

<p>“Guess she thinks she owns you, Neale,”
chuckled one of the boys, adding fuel to the flames.
Neale did not feel any too pleasant after that.
He flung away from Trix Severn’s detaining
grasp.</p>

<p>“I’m going—it isn’t any of <i>your</i> concern,” he
muttered, to the angry girl.</p>

<p>Ruth bore Agnes away. She was half crying.
The rift in the intimacy between her soulmate and
herself was apparent to all.</p>

<p>To make the matter worse—according to Trix’s
version—when Neale finally returned, almost
breathless, with the mislaid slippers, he insisted,
first of all, upon dancing with Ruth and Agnes.
Then he would have favored Trix (Ruth had advised
it), but the angry girl would not speak to
him.</p>

<p>“He’s nothing but a low circus boy, anyway!”
she told Lucy Poole. “And I don’t think really
well-bred girls would care to have anything to
do with him.”</p>

<p>Those who heard her laughed. They had
known Trix Severn’s ways for a long time. She
had been upon her good behavior; but it did not
surprise her old acquaintances that she should
act like this.</p>

<p>It made a difference to the Corner House girls,
however, for it made their plans about going to
Pleasant Cove uncertain.</p>

<p>The other girls knew that Trix had invited the
Corner House girls for the first two weeks after
graduation, and that Ruth had tentatively accepted.
Therefore even Pearl Harrod—who
wanted Ruth and her sisters, herself—scarcely
knew whether to put in a claim for them or not.</p>

<p>Graduation Day was very near at hand; the
very day following the closing of the Milton High,
several family parties were to leave for the seaside
resort which was so popular in this part of
New England.</p>

<p>They had to pass through Bloomingsburg to
get to it, but when the Kenways had lived in that
city, they had never expected to spend any part
of the summer season at such a beautiful summer
resort as Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>It was a bungalow colony, with several fine
hotels, built around a tiny, old-fashioned fishing
port. There was a still cove, a beautiful river
emptying into it, and outside, a stretch of rocky
Atlantic coast on which the ocean played grim
tunes during stormy weather.</p>

<p>This was as much as the Corner House girls
knew about it as yet. But they all looked forward
to their first visit to the place with keen delight.
Tess and Dot were talking about the expected
trip a good deal of the time they were
awake. Most of their doll-play was colored now
by thoughts of Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>They were not too busy to help Mrs. MacCall
take the last of the winter clothing to the garret,
however, and see her pack it away in the chests
there. As she did this the housekeeper sprinkled,
with lavish hand, the camphor balls among the
layers of clothing.</p>

<p>Dot had tentatively tasted one of the hard,
white balls, and shuddered. “But they <i>do</i> look
so much like candy, Tess,” she said. Then she
suddenly had another thought:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. MacCall! what do you suppose the
poor moths had to live on ’way back in the Garden
of Eden before Adam and Eve wore any
clothes?”</p>

<p>“Now, can you beat <i>that</i>?” demanded the
housekeeper, of nobody in particular. “What
won’t that young one get in her head!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ruth was helping Rosa Wildwood
all she could, so that the girl from the South would
be able to pass in the necessary examinations and
stand high enough in the class to be promoted.</p>

<p>Housework certainly “told on” Rosa. Bob
said “it jest seems t’ take th’ puckerin’ string
all out’n her—an’ she jest draps down like a
flower.”</p>

<p>“We’ll help her, Mr. Wildwood,” Ruth said.
“But she really ought to have a rest.”</p>

<p>“Hi Godfrey!” ejaculated the coal heaver. “I
tell her she kin let the housework go. We don’t
have no visitors—savin’ an’ exceptin’ <i>you</i>,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“But she wants to keep the place decent, you
see,” Ruth told him. “And she can scarcely do
that and keep up with her studies—now. You
see, she’s so weak.”</p>

<p>“Hi Godfrey!” exclaimed the man again.
“Ain’t thar sech a thing as bein’ a mite <i>too</i>
clean?”</p>

<p>But Bob Wildwood had an immense respect
for Ruth; likewise he was grateful because she
showed an interest in his last remaining daughter.</p>

<p>“I tell you, sir,” the oldest Corner House girl
said, gravely. “Rosa needs a change and a rest.
And all us girls are going to Pleasant Cove this
summer. Will you let Rosa come down, too, for
a while, if I pay her way and look out for her?”</p>

<p>The man was somewhat disturbed by the question.
“Yuh see, Miss,” he observed, scratching
his head thoughtfully, “she’s all I got. I’d
plumb be lost ’ithout Rosa.”</p>

<p>“But only for a week or two.”</p>

<p>“I know. And I wouldn’t want tuh stand in
her way. I crossed her sister too much—that’s
what <i>I</i> did. Juniper was a sight more uppity
than Rosa—otherwise she wouldn’t have flew the
coop,” said Bob Wildwood, shaking his head.</p>

<p>Ruth, all tenderness for his bereavement, hastened
to say: “Oh, you’ll find her again, sir.
Surely you don’t believe she’s dead?”</p>

<p>“No. If she ain’t come to a <i>bad</i> end, she’s all
right somewhar. But she’d oughter be home
with her sister—and with me. Ye see, she was
pretty—an’ smart. No end smart! She went
off in bad comp’ny.”</p>

<p>“How do you mean, Mr. Wildwood?” asked
Ruth, deeply interested.</p>

<p>“Travelin’ folks. They had a van an’ a couple
team o’ mules, an’ the man sold bitters an’ corn-salve.
The woman dressed mighty fine, an’ she
took June’s eye.</p>

<p>“We follered ’em a long spell, me an’ Rosa.
But we didn’t never ketch up to ’em. If we had,
I’d sure tuck a hand-holt of that medicine man.
He an’ his woman put all the foolishness inter
Juniper’s haid.</p>

<p>“An’ Rosa misses her sister like poison, too,”
finished Bob Wildwood, slowly shaking his head.</p>

<p>There seemed to be a mystery connected with
the disappearance of Rosa’s sister, and Ruth
Kenway was just as curious as she could be about
it; but she stuck to her subject until Bob Wildwood
agreed to spare his remaining daughter for
at least a week’s visit to Pleasant Cove, while
the Corner House girls would be there.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink05'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER V—OFF FOR THE SEASIDE</a></h2>

<p>The last hours of the school term were busy
ones indeed. Even Tess had her troublesome
“’zaminations.” At the study table on the last
evening before her own grade had its closing exercises,
Tess propounded the following:</p>

<p>“Ruthie, what’s a ’scutcheon?”</p>

<p>“Um—um,” said Ruth, far away.</p>

<p>“A <i>what</i>, child?” demanded Agnes.</p>

<p>“‘’Scutcheon?’”</p>

<p>“‘Escutcheon,’ she means,” chuckled Neale,
who was present as usual at study hour.</p>

<p>“Well, what <i>is</i> it?” begged Tess, plaintively.</p>

<p>“Why?” demanded Ruth, suddenly waking up.
“That’s a hard word for a small girl, Tess.”</p>

<p>“It says here,” quoth Tess, “that ‘There was
a blot upon his escutcheon.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes—sure,” drawled Neale, as Ruth hesitated.
“That must mean a fancy vest, Tess.
And he spilled soup on it—sure!”</p>

<p>“Now Neale! how horrid!” admonished Ruth,
while Agnes giggled.</p>

<p>“I do think you are all awful mean to me,”
wailed Tess. “You don’t tell me a thing.
You’re almost as mean as Trix Severn was to
me to-day. I don’t want to go to her father’s
hotel, so there! Have we got to, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“What did she do to you, Tess?” demanded
Agnes, with a curiosity she could not quench.
For, deep as the chasm had grown between her
and her former chum, she could not ignore Trix.</p>

<p>“She just turned up her nose at me,” complained
Tess, “when I went by; and I heard her
say to some girl she was with: ‘There goes one
of them now. They pushed their way into our
party, and I s’pose we’ve got to entertain them.’
Now, <i>did</i> we push our way in, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>Ruth was angry. It was not often that she displayed
indignation, so that when she did so, the
other girls—and even Neale—were the more impressed.</p>

<p>“Of course she was speaking of that wretched
invitation she gave us to stay at her father’s
hotel at Pleasant Cove,” said Ruth. “Well!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruthie! don’t say you won’t go,” begged
Agnes.</p>

<p>“I’ll never go to that Overlook House unless
we pay our way—be sure of that,” declared the
angry Ruth.</p>

<p>“But we <i>are</i> going to the shore, Ruthie?”
asked Tess.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Pearl Harrod will ask us again,” murmured
Agnes, hopefully.</p>

<p>“I guess we can pay our way and be beholden
to nobody,” said Ruth, shortly. “I will hire one
of the tents, if nothing else. And we’ll start the
very day after High closes, just as we planned.”</p>

<p>Despite the loss of her “soulmate,” Agnes
was pretty cheerful. She was to graduate from
grammar school; and although she was sorry to
lose Miss Georgiana Shipman as a teacher, she
was delighted to get out of “the pigtail classes,”
as she rudely termed the lower grades.</p>

<p>“I’m going to do up my hair, Ruthie, whatever
you say,” she declared, “just as soon as I
get into high school next fall. I’m old enough
to forget braids and hair-ribbons, I should hope!”</p>

<p>“Not yet, my child, not yet,” laughed Ruth.
“Why! there are more girls in High who wear
their hair <i>down</i> than <i>up</i>.”</p>

<p>“But I’m so big——”</p>

<p>“You mean, you’d be big,” chuckled Neale, “if
you were only rolled out,” for he was always
teasing Agnes about her plumpness.</p>

<p>“Well! I want to celebrate some way,” sighed
Agnes. “Can’t we have a specially nice supper
that night?”</p>

<p>“Surely, child,” said her sedate sister.
“What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Well!” repeated Agnes, slowly; “you know
I’ll never graduate from Grammar again.
Couldn’t we kill some of those nice frying
chickens of yours, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“Oh, my!” cried Neale. “What have the poor
chickens done that they should be slaughtered to
make a Roman holiday?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Smartie!” snapped Agnes. “You be
good, or you sha’n’t have any.”</p>

<p>“If that Tom Jonah hadn’t been busy on a
certain night, none of us would have eaten those
particular frying chickens,” laughed Neale. “I
wonder if that Gypsy is running yet?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t get the frying chickens in the bag,”
said Agnes. “They were in another coop. We
hatched them in January and brought them up
by hand. Say! I don’t believe you know much
about natural history, Neale, anyway.”</p>

<p>“I guess he knows more than Sammy Pinkney
does,” Tess said, again drawn into the conversation.
“Teacher asked him to tell us two breeds
of dairy cattle and which gives the most milk.
She’d been reading to us about it out of a book.
So Sammy says:</p>

<p>“‘The bull and the cow, Miss Andrews; and
the cow gives the most milk.’”</p>

<p>Dot’s school held its closing exercises one
morning, and Tess’ in the afternoon. Then came
the graduation of Agnes and Neale O’Neil from
the grammar school. Ruth was excused from
her own classes at High long enough to attend
her sister’s graduation.</p>

<p>Although the plump Corner House girl was
no genius, she always stood well in her classes.
Ruth saw to that, for what Agnes did not learn
at school she had to study at home.</p>

<p>So she stood well up in her class, and she <i>did</i>
look “too distractingly pretty,” as Mrs. MacCall
declared, when she gave the last touches to Agnes’
dress before she started for school that last day.
Miss Ann Titus, Milton’s most famous seamstress
and “gossip-in-ordinary,” had outdone
herself in making Agnes’ dress. No girl in her
class—not even Trix Severn—was dressed so becomingly.</p>

<p>The envious Trix heard the commendations
showered on her former friend, and her face grew
sourer and her temper sharper. She well knew
she had invited the Corner House girls to be her
guests at Pleasant Cove; but she did not want
them in her party now. She did not know how to
get out of “the fix,” as she called it in her own
mind.</p>

<p>She had intimated to two or three other girls
who were going, however, that Agnes and Ruth
had forced the invitation from her in a moment of
weakness. If she had to number them of her
party, Miss Trix proposed to make it just as unpleasant
for the Kenway sisters as she could.</p>

<p>High school graduation was on Thursday. On
Friday a special through train was put on by the
railroad from Milton to Pleasant Cove. It was
scheduled to leave the former station at ten
o’clock.</p>

<p>Luckily Mrs. MacCall had insisted upon having
all the trunks and bags packed the day before, for
on this Friday morning the Corner House girls
had little time for anything but saying
“good-bye” to their many friends, both human and
dumb.</p>

<p>“Whatever will Tom Jonah think?” cried
Tess, hugging the big dog that had taken up his
abode at the Corner House so strangely. “He’ll
think we have run away from him, poor fellow!”</p>

<p>“Oh! <i>don’t</i> you think that, Tom Jonah!”
begged Dot, seizing the dog on the other side.
“We all love you so! And we’ll come back to
you.”</p>

<p>“You’ll give him just the best care ever, won’t
you, Uncle Rufus?” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Sho’ will!” agreed the old colored man.</p>

<p>“<i>Can’t</i> we take him with us, Ruthie?” asked
Dot.</p>

<p>Ruth would have been tempted to do just this
had she been sure that they would hire a tent in
the colony as soon as they reached Pleasant Cove.
Tom Jonah was just the sort of a protector the
Corner House girl would have chosen under those
circumstances.</p>

<p>But Ruth was puzzled. She had not seen
Pearl Harrod, and was not sure whether Pearl
had completely filled her uncle’s bungalow with
guests or not. Of one thing Ruth was sure: if
they went to the Overlook House (Mr. Terrence
Severn’s hotel), they would pay their board and
refuse to be Trix’s guests.</p>

<p>When the carriage came for them, Tom Jonah
stood at the gate and watched them get in and
drive away with a rather depressed air. Dot and
Tess waved their handkerchiefs from the carriage
window at him as long as they could see the big
dog.</p>

<p>There was much confusion at the station.
Many people whom the girls knew were on the
platform, or in the cars already. Trix Severn
was very much in evidence. The Kenway sisters
saw the other girls who were going to accept Miss
Severn’s hospitality in a group at one side, but
they hesitated to join this party.</p>

<p>Trix passed the Kenways twice and did not
even look at them. Of course, she knew the sisters
were there, but Ruth believed that the mean-spirited
girl merely wished them to speak to her
so that she could snub them publicly.</p>

<p>“Well, Ruthie Kenway!” exclaimed a voice
suddenly behind the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>It was Pearl Harrod. Pearl was a bright-faced,
big girl, jovial and kind-hearted. “I’ve
just been looking for you everywhere,” pursued
Pearl. “Here it is the last minute, and you
haven’t told me whether you and the other girls
are going to my uncle’s house or not.”</p>

<p>“Why—if you are sure you want us?” queried
Ruth, with a little break in her voice.</p>

<p>“I should say yes!” exclaimed Pearl. “But
I was afraid you had been asked by some one
else.”</p>

<p>Trix turned and looked the four sisters over
scornfully. Then she tossed her head.
“Waiting like beggars for an invitation from <i>some</i>body,”
she said, loudly enough for all the girls
nearby to hear. “You’d think, if those Corner
House girls are as rich as they tell about, that
they’d pay their way.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink06'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VI—ON THE TRAIN</a></h2>

<p>“Don’t you mind what that mean thing says,”
whispered Pearl Harrod, quickly.</p>

<p>She had seen Ruth flush hotly and the tears
spring to Agnes’ eyes when Trix Severn had
spoken so ill-naturedly. The younger Corner
House girls did not hear, but Ruth and Agnes
were hurt to the quick.</p>

<p>“You are very, very kind, Pearl,” said Ruth.
“But we had thought of going to the tent
colony——”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Trix Severn ask you to her place?”
demanded Pearl, hotly. “I <i>know</i> she did. And
now she insults you. If she hadn’t asked you
first, and seemed so thick with your sister, Ruth,
I would have insisted long ago that you all come
to uncle’s bungalow. There’s plenty of room,
for my aunt and the girls won’t be down for a
fortnight.”</p>

<p>“But, Pearl——”</p>

<p>“I’ll be mad if you don’t agree—now I know
that Trix has released you, Ruth Kenway,” cried
the good-hearted girl. “Now, don’t let’s say
another word about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be angry!” begged Ruth. “But
won’t it look as though we <i>were</i> begging our way—as
Trix says?”</p>

<p>“Pooh! who cares for Trix Severn?”</p>

<p>“You—you are very kind,” said Ruth, yielding
at length.</p>

<p>“Then you come on. Hey, girls!” she shouted,
running after her own particular friends who
were climbing aboard the rear car. “I’ve gotten
them to promise. The Corner House girls
are going with us—for two weeks, anyway.”</p>

<p>At once the other girls addressed cheered and
gathered the four Kenways into their group, with
great rejoicing. The sting of Trix Severn’s unkindness
was forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. Howbridge, their guardian, came to the
station to see them off, and shook hands with Ruth
through the window of the car. When the train
actually moved away, Neale O’Neil was there in
the crowd, swinging his cap and wishing them
heaps of fun. Neale expected to go to Pleasant
Cove himself, later in the season.</p>

<p>This last car of the special train was a day
coach; but the light-hearted girls did not mind
the lack of conveniences and comforts to be obtained
in the chair cars. The train was supposed
to arrive at Pleasant Cove by three o’clock, and
a five hour ride on a hot June day was only “fun”
for the Corner House girls and their friends.</p>

<p>Ruth first of all got the brakeman to turn over
a seat so that she and her three sisters could
sit facing each other. Mrs. MacCall had put
them up a nice hamper of luncheon and the older
girl knew this would be better enjoyed if the
seats were thus arranged.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the usual desire of some
of the travelers to have windows open while
others wished them closed. Cinders and dust
flew in by the peck if the former arrangement prevailed,
while the heat was intense if the sashes
were down.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were little disturbed by these
physical ills. But they had their own worries.
Dot, who had insisted on carrying the Alice-doll
in her arms, was troubled mightily to remember
whether she had packed the whole of the doll’s
trousseau (this was supposed to be a wedding
journey for the Alice-doll—a wedding journey in
which the bridegroom had no part); while Tess
wondered what would happen to Tom Jonah and
Sandyface’s young family while they were all
gone from the old Corner House.</p>

<p>“I feel condemned—I do, indeed, Dot,” sighed
Tess. “We ought, at least, to have named those
four kittens before we left. They’ll be awfully
old before the christening—if we don’t come back
at the end of our first two weeks.”</p>

<p>“What could happen to them?” demanded Dot.</p>

<p>“Why—croup—or measles—or chicken-pox.
They’re only babies, you know. And if one
should die,” added Tess, warmly, “we wouldn’t
even know what name to put on its gravestone!”</p>

<p>“My! lots of things can happen in two weeks,
I s’pose,” agreed Dot. “Do you think we ought
to stay away from home so long?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to if Ruth and Aggie stay,”
said Tess. “But I shall worry.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Agnes, who sat with her back to
the engine beside Ruth, had become interested in
a couple sitting together not far down the car.
They were strangers—and strangely dressed, as
well.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!” Agnes exclaimed, under her
breath, “they look like Gypsies.”</p>

<p>“If they are, they are much better dressed than
any Gypsies we ever saw before,” observed her
sister.</p>

<p>“But how gay!”</p>

<p>This comment was just enough. The older
one had shocking taste in millinery. She wore,
too, long, pendant ear-rings and her fingers were
covered with gaudy looking jewels. Her garments
were rich in texture, but oddly made, and
the contrasts in color were, as Agnes whispered,
“fierce!”</p>

<p>“That girl with her is handsome, just the
same,” Ruth declared.</p>

<p>“Oh! isn’t she!” whispered the enthusiastic
Agnes. “A perfectly stunning brunette.”</p>

<p>If she were a Gypsy girl she was a very beautiful
one. Her features were lovely and her complexion
brilliant. When she smiled she flashed
two rows of perfect teeth upon the beholder. She
might have been a year or two older than Ruth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—somehow—she reminds me of
somebody,” murmured the latter.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“The girl.”</p>

<p>“She reminds me of that chicken-thief Tom
Jonah treed on the henhouse roof,” chuckled
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Ruth; “all Gypsies can’t be
alike.”</p>

<p>“Humph! you never heard a good word said
for them,” sniffed Agnes.</p>

<p>“But that doesn’t prove there are not good
ones. They are a wandering people and have no
particular trade or standing in any community.
Naturally they have a lot of crimes laid upon
their shoulders that they never commit,” said the
just Ruth.</p>

<p>“That was one of them that tried to steal your
hens, just the same,” said Agnes.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” admitted her sister. “But
surely <i>these</i> two cannot belong to the same kind
of Gypsies. See how richly they are dressed.”</p>

<p>“I guess that doesn’t make any difference,”
said Agnes. “They are all cut off the same piece
of goods,” and immediately she lost interest in
the strange couple when Lucy Poole came up the
aisle to speak to her.</p>

<p>Ruth had the gaily dressed woman and her
companion on her mind a good deal. She often
looked at them when they did not notice her. The
woman must have been forty, but was straight,
lithe, and of good figure. She sat on the outer
end of the seat, having the girl between her and
the window.</p>

<p>The latter seemed more and more familiar in
appearance to Ruth as she looked, yet the Corner
House girl could not say whom the girl looked
like.</p>

<p>The latter scarcely spoke to her companion.
Indeed, she kept her face toward the window for
the most part, and seemed to be in a sullen mood.
She had smiled once at Dot and the Alice-doll,
and that was the only time Ruth had seen the
dark, beautiful face with an attractive expression
upon it.</p>

<p>The woman seemed talkative enough, but what
language she jabbered to her companion the Corner
House girl could not tell. She frequently
leaned toward the dark girl, her bejeweled fingers
seizing the sleeve of her waist, and her speech
was both emphatic and loud.</p>

<p>The rattle of the train drowned, however, most
of the woman’s words. Ruth arose and went the
length of the car for a drink, just for the purpose
of overhearing the strange speech of the
Gypsy (if such the woman was) for she was sure
the language was not English.</p>

<p>She heard nothing intelligible. Ruth folded a
cup, filled it at the ice-water tank, and brought it
back for the children. Pearl Harrod was sitting
directly behind the two strangers, in a seat with
Carrie Poole.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Ruth!” Pearl said, “is it a fact
that Rosa Wildwood is coming down to the Cove
next week?”</p>

<p>Ruth turned to answer. As she did so the girl
in the seat with the Gypsy sprang to her feet,
her face transfigured with amazement, or alarm—Ruth
did not know which. The woman grabbed
her by the elbow and pulled her back into the
seat, saying something of a threatening nature to
her companion.</p>

<p>In her excitement the woman knocked the cup
of water from Ruth’s hand. She turned to apologize,
and Ruth, looking over her head, saw the
dark-skinned girl sitting back in her corner quite
colorless and broken. The Corner House girl
was sure, too, that the strange girl’s lips formed
the name “Rosa Wildwood”—but she made no
sound.</p>

<p>“It is all right,” Ruth assured the Gypsy
woman. “No harm done.”</p>

<p>“I am the ver’ awkward one—eh?” repeated
the woman, with a hard smile.</p>

<p>“It does not matter,” said Ruth. “I can get
another cup of water.”</p>

<p>She returned to do so. All the while she was
wondering what the incident meant. It was not
merely a chance happening, she was sure. Something
about the name of her schoolmate, Rosa
Wildwood, had frightened the beautiful girl who
was evidently in the Gypsy woman’s care.</p>

<p>Ruth grew quite excited as she drew another
cup of water, and she swiftly planned to discover
the mystery, as she started up the aisle of the
coach a second time.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink07'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VII—SOMETHING AHEAD</a></h2>

<p>Pearl Harrod was now busily talking with
Carrie Poole again; she had probably forgotten
about Rosa Wildwood for the time being. But
Ruth stopped at her seat—the seat directly behind
that occupied by the two strangers.</p>

<p>“You asked about Rosa, Pearl?” said Ruth,
speaking loudly enough, she was sure, for the girl
in front to hear.</p>

<p>“Oh, hello! don’t spill that water again,
Ruthie,” laughed Pearl. “Yes. I asked if she
were coming down to the Cove!”</p>

<p>“Yes. Rosa Wildwood expects to come next
week. I am going to find her a boarding place.”</p>

<p>Ruth spoke very distinctly, and she kept her
eyes fastened upon the back of the strange girl’s
head. But the latter gave no sign of having
heard—at least, she appeared not to be interested
in the name which had before so startled her.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how the poor girl can afford it,”
Carrie Poole said, not unkindly. “They say she
and her father are very poor.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bob Wildwood works regularly. He
doesn’t drink any more,” Ruth explained,
intentionally speaking so that those in the forward
seat could hear if they wished to listen.</p>

<p>“Rosa is an awfully sweet girl,” said Carrie.</p>

<p>“I love that little Southern drawl of hers!”
cried Pearl. “She says ‘Ah reckon so’ in just
the <i>cunningest</i> way!”</p>

<p>“She is very frail,” Ruth continued, clearly.
“I was afraid she would break down before the
school term closed. Now it has been arranged for
her to stay at Pleasant Cove until she gains
strength. Dr. Forsythe says it will do her a
world of good.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give her a good time, all right,” declared
Pearl. “Wish we could have her with
us——”</p>

<p>“Not at the bungalow,” said Ruth. “Nor at
the hotel. We want a quiet place for her. I
shall find it.”</p>

<p>Not a sign did the girl in front give that she
heard any of this conversation. Yet Ruth believed
there was a curious intentness in her manner—she
held her head very still as though she
were secretly listening, while apparently giving
all her attention to what the train passed.</p>

<p>“What does your uncle call his bungalow—where
we shall stop?” asked Ruth of Pearl.</p>

<p>“Why, the Spoondrift—don’t you remember?
It’s at this end of the cove, near the river, and
we have bathing rights on the shore. It’s a fine
place. You’ll <i>love</i> it, Ruth Kenway.”</p>

<p>“I expect to,” said Ruth, seriously. “And you
were very kind to ask me to stay two whole weeks
with you,” and Ruth passed on.</p>

<p>She had intentionally said enough so that, if
the strange girl <i>were</i> listening, she would learn
just where Ruth could be found at Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>For the Corner House girl felt that the dark
beauty with the Gypsy woman held some keen interest
in Rosa Wildwood. Of course—right at
the start—the story of Rosa’s lost sister, June,
had come into Ruth’s mind.</p>

<p>Yet, as the Corner House girl looked at the
stranger, she could not say truthfully that it was
Rosa of whom <i>this</i> girl reminded her. Ruth conjured
before her mind’s eye the fair, delicate
beauty of Bob Wildwood’s daughter; the two
girls possessed no feature in common—and in
complexion they were, of course, diametrically
opposed.</p>

<p>This girl was dark enough and savage enough
looking to be a Gypsy. Ruth scouted the idea
that she might be Juniper Wildwood, who had run
away with a traveling “medicine man” and his
wife.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ruth believed that the strange
girl must know something about the lost June
Wildwood. She had been startled when Rosa’s
name was mentioned. The Corner House girl
was deeply interested in the affair; but at present
she did not want to take anybody into her confidence
about it—not even Agnes.</p>

<p>The girls did not remain quietly in their seats,
by any manner of means. First there was a
crowd blocking the aisle in one part of the car,
then in another. Agnes was in and out of her
seat half a dozen times between stations. The
heat and dust was ignored as the girls shouted
pleasantries back and forth; the air was vibrant
with laughter.</p>

<p>“I’m just as anxious to see the ocean as I can
be,” declared Lucy Poole who, like the Corner
House girls, had never been to Pleasant Cove before.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” scoffed her cousin Carrie.
“It’s only a big, big pond! Our frog pond at
home looks like a piece of the ocean—when it’s
calm.”</p>

<p>The others laughed and Pearl said: “Guess
Lucy wants to see Old Ocean in its might, eh?
Big storm, whales, great ships——”</p>

<p>“A sea serpent!” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“Of course—if there is such a thing,” admitted
Lucy. “A sea serpent must be an awfully interesting
sight.”</p>

<p>“There aren’t any more,” said Pearl. “Father
Neptune’s all out of stock.”</p>

<p>“I guess the sea serpent is something like the
<i>snakes</i> alcoholic victims think they see,” proposed
Carrie.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” proclaimed Agnes. “Here’s what
I read about the sea serpent:</p>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    “‘The old sea serpent used to rave<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      And fiercely roam about;<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;    He hit a prohibition wave,<br/>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;      And that’s what knocked him out.’”<br/>
</p>

<p>“‘Perils of the Deep!’” laughed Ruth. “But
even if we don’t see serpents in the ocean, I expect
we’ll have plenty of adventures down there
at the shore.”</p>

<p>Which prophecy was strangely fulfilled.</p>

<p>The train reached Bloomingsburg about one
o’clock, and was immediately shifted to the single-tracked
branch line that connected that small city
with Pleasant Cove. The speed of the train after
leaving Bloomingsburg was not great, for it was
often held up for trains coming from the shore
to pass.</p>

<p>The adult passengers grew impatient and
wearied. There were many complaints, and the
babies began to fret and cry. But our friends in
the last coach remained in a jolly and—for the
most part—kindly mood.</p>

<p>Trix Severn had taken her crowd into a forward
coach. Her father owning one of the big
hotels at the Cove, the railroad company had
presented him with a sheaf of chair coupons.
So, as Pearl Harrod laughingly said, “Trix’s
party was as swell as a wet sponge.”</p>

<p>“I don’t suppose any of that crowd at the Overlook
House will talk to <i>us</i>,” said Pearl. “Just
the same, I guess I can show you girls a good time
at Spoondrift. Uncle always lets us do just as
we like. He’s the <i>dearest</i> man.”</p>

<p>The train rattled on and on. The alternate
pine forests and swamp lands seemed interminable.
Now and then they went through a cut,
the railroad bisecting a hickory ridge.</p>

<p>But soon there was a change in the air. When
the cinders and dust did not sift into the windows,
there was a smell of salt marsh. The air
seemed suddenly cleaner. At one station where
they stopped, a salt creek came in, and there was
a dock, and boats, and barrels of clams and fish
piled on the platform ready for the next up-train.</p>

<p>“Regular maritime smell——whew!” sighed
Carrie Poole, holding her nose delicately.</p>

<p>“Oh! The <i>whole</i> of Pleasant Cove doesn’t
smell like this, does it?” demanded her cousin.</p>

<p>“Only the old part of it—the old village.”</p>

<p>“Well! that’s lucky,” said Lucy. “If this
odor prevailed I should say the place ought to
be called <i>Un</i>-pleasant Cove.”</p>

<p>“How far are we from the jumping-off place?”
demanded Agnes. “I’d like to get out and run.”</p>

<p>Pearl stooped to look out under one of the
drawn shades. “Why!” she said, “there are
only two more stops before we reach the Cove
station. It’s a winding way the railroad follows.
But if we got off about here and went right
through those woods yonder, we’d reach the
Spoondrift bungalow in an hour. I’ve walked
over here to Jumpertown many a time.”</p>

<p>“Jumpertown?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That’s what they called it before the
real estate speculators gave it the fancy name of
‘Ridgedale Station.’”</p>

<p>At that moment the train suddenly slowed
down. The brakes grated upon the wheels and
everybody clung to the seats for support. One
of the brakemen ran through from the front and
the girls clamored to know the cause of the stoppage.</p>

<p>“Bridge down up front,” said the railroad employee.
“Tide rose last night and loosened the
supports. We’ve got to wait.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” was the general wail. When
they could get hold of the conductor the girls demanded
to know the length of time they would
be delayed.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell you, young ladies,” declared the
man of the punch. “There’s a repair gang at
work on it now.”</p>

<p>“An hour?” demanded Pearl Harrod.</p>

<p>“Oh, longer than that,” the conductor assured
her.</p>

<p>“But what shall we do? We want to get to the
bungalow and air the bedclothes, and all that,
before dark,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Guess you’ll have to walk, then,” said the
conductor, laughing, and went away.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’ll do,” Pearl said to her
friends. “Can the children walk three miles,
Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Surely they can!” Agnes cried. “If they
can’t, we’ll carry them.”</p>

<p>Ruth was doubtful of the wisdom of the move,
but her opinion was not asked.</p>

<p>“Come on! let’s get out quietly. We’ll fool all
these other folks,” said Pearl. “We’ll get to
Pleasant Cove long before they do.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink08'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER VIII—THE GYPSY CAMP</a></h2>

<p>There were two things that encouraged Ruth
Kenway, the oldest Corner House girl, to accompany
Pearl Harrod’s party through the
woods without objection. Pearl told her that
when they reached the highway on the other side
of the timber in all probability they would be
overtaken by an auto-bus that ran four times a
day between a station on a rival railroad line
and the Cove.</p>

<p>This was one thing. The other reason for
Ruth’s leaving the train with her sisters, and
without objection, was the fact that the strangely
dressed woman and the pretty, dark girl had left
it already.</p>

<p>When the train first stopped and the brakeman
announced the accident ahead, the woman had
spoken to the girl and they both had risen and
left the car. Perhaps nobody had noticed them
but Ruth. The strange girl had not looked at
Ruth when she passed her, but the woman had
bowed and smiled in a cat-like fashion.</p>

<p>Pearl said they would follow a path through
the timber to the road; and she pointed out the
direction through the window. Ruth saw the
woman and girl strike into this very path and
disappear.</p>

<p>So curiosity, too, led the oldest Corner House
girl to agree to Pearl’s plan. The party of ten
girls, including Ruth, Agnes, Tess and Dot Kenway,
slipped out of the car without being questioned
by any of the older people there. Nobody
observed them enter the cool and fragrant
woods. Chattering and laughing, they were
quickly in the shadowy depths and out of sight
of the hot train.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t this heavenly!” cried Agnes, tossing
up her hat by the ribbons that were supposed to
tie it under her plump chin.</p>

<p>The green tunnel of the wood-path stretched a
long way before them. It was paved with pine
needles and last-year’s oak leaves.</p>

<p>Ruth looked sharply ahead, but did not see
either the woman or the girl, in whom she was
so much interested. Either they had gone on
very rapidly, or had turned aside into the wood.</p>

<p>Dot had made no complaint upon being forced
to leave the train; but she clung very tightly now
to the Alice-doll, and finally ventured to ask
Tess:</p>

<p>“What—what do you think is the chance for
<i>bears</i> in this wood, Tess? Don’t you think there
may be some?”</p>

<p>“Bears? Whoever heard the like? Of course
not, child,” said Tess, in her most elder-sisterly
way. “What gave you such an idea as that?”</p>

<p>“Well—it’s a strange woods, Tess. We aren’t
really acquainted here.”</p>

<p>“But Pearl is,” declared Tess, stoutly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I’d rather have Tom Jonah
with us. Suppose a bear should jump out and
grab Alice?” and she hugged the doll all the
closer in her arms. For her own safety she evidently
was not anxious.</p>

<p>The girls, after their ride in the train, were
like young colts let loose in a paddock. They
sang and laughed and capered; and when they
came to a softly carpeted hollow, Pearl Harrod
led the way and rolled down the slope, instead
of walking down in a “decorous manner, as high
school young ladies should,” quoth Carrie.</p>

<p>“If our dear, <i>de-ar</i> teachers should see us
now!” gasped Pearl sitting up at the foot of the
slide, with a peck of pine needles in her hair and
her frock all tousled.</p>

<p>Their only baggage was the lunch baskets and
boxes. All other of their personal possessions
were on the train, in the baggage car. But the
remains of the luncheons came in very nicely.
Before they had gone a mile through the wood
they were all loudly proclaiming their hunger.</p>

<p>So they found a spring, and camped about it,
eating the remainder of the lunches to the very
last crumb. And such a hilarious “feed” as it
was!</p>

<p>Ruth forgot all about the Gypsy woman and the
girl who had so puzzled her by her actions. The
rest by the spring refreshed even Dot. She was
plucky, if she <i>was</i> little; and she made no complaint
at all about the long walk through the
stretch of timber.</p>

<p>The party did not hurry after that rest. It
was still early in the afternoon and Pearl, referring
to her watch, said they would surely
catch the auto-stage that passed on the main road
about four o’clock.</p>

<p>“You see, there are no servants at the bungalow
yet,” Pearl explained. “Uncle has been taking
his meals at one of the small boarding-houses
nearby, that opens early. He is a great fisherman,
and always goes down early and ‘roughs
it’ at the bungalow until my aunt comes down.</p>

<p>“But she thought we girls would be able to get
on all right—with Uncle Phil to give us a hand
if we need him. We’ll have to air bedclothes,
and get in groceries, and otherwise start housekeeping
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Why! it will be great fun,” Ruth said. “Just
like playing house together.”</p>

<p>“Say!” cried Agnes. “We want more than
‘play-house’ food to eat—now I warn you! No
sweet crackers and ‘cambric tea’ for mine, if you
please!”</p>

<p>“Oh! if I ask him,” said Pearl, laughing, “I
know Uncle Phil will take us to his boarding-house
to supper to-night—if we get there late.
But I want to show him what ten girls can do
toward housekeeping.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be plenty of cooks to spoil the broth,”
sighed Agnes. “Did you ever see <i>me</i> fry an
egg?”</p>

<p>Ruth began to laugh. The single occasion when
Agnes had tried her hand at the breakfast eggs
was a day marked for remembrance at the old
Corner House.</p>

<p>“What can you do to a defenseless egg,
Aggie?” Lucy Poole demanded.</p>

<p>“Plenty!” declared Agnes, shaking her head.
“When I get through with an egg, a lump of butter,
and a frying-pan, there is left a residue of
charred ‘what is it?’ in the bottom of the pan,
an odor of burned grease in the kitchen—and me
in hysterics! It was an awful occasion when I
tackled that egg. I’ve not felt just right about
approaching an egg since that never-to-be-forgotten
day.”</p>

<p>“I was left home to cook for my father, once,”
said Carrie Poole, seriously, “and he asked to
have boiled rice for supper. Mother never let
me cook much, and I didn’t know a thing about
<i>rice</i>.</p>

<p>“But I saw the grains were awfully small, and
I knew my father liked a great, heaping bowlful
when he had it, so I told the grocery boy to bring
two pounds, and I tried to cook it all.”</p>

<p>A general laugh hailed this announcement.
Agnes asked: “What happened, Carrie? I
don’t know anything about rice myself—’cepting
that it’s good in cakes and you throw it after
brides for luck—and—and Chinamen live on it.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” urged Carrie, solemnly. “It’s nothing
to laugh at. I began cooking it in a four
quart saucepan, so as to give it plenty of room;
and when father came in just before supper time,
I had the whole top of our big range covered
with pots and pans into which I had dipped the
overflow of that two pounds of rice!</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I had!” said Carrie, warmly, while
the others screamed with laughter. “And I had
gotten so excited by that time that I begged father
to go out to the washhouse and bring in the big
clothes boiler, so’s to see if I could keep the stuff
from running over onto the stove.</p>

<p>“You never saw such a mess,” concluded Carrie,
shaking her head. “And we had to eat rice
for a week!”</p>

<p>It was just here that Agnes spied something
far ahead beside the woodspath.</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, “are we in sight of the tent
colony you tell about, so soon?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Pearl Harrod. “We’re
nowhere near the river.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a tent!” exclaimed Agnes, earnestly.</p>

<p>“And I see the top of another,” said Lucy
Poole.</p>

<p>“Dirty brown things, both of them. Look
more like Indian wigwams,” announced Ann
Presby.</p>

<p>“My goodness, girls! there are the Gypsies
Uncle Phil wrote about,” said Pearl, in some excitement.
“Let’s get our fortunes told.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me,” said Ruth, rather worriedly.
“I don’t just <i>like</i> Gypsies.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you haven’t got to hug and kiss them!”
laughed Pearl. “Come on! they’re lots of fun.”</p>

<p>But when the party of girls drew nearer to the
Gypsy camp, this particular tribe of Nomads did
not appear to be “lots of fun,” after all.</p>

<p>In the first place, the tents—as Ann had said—were
very shabby and dirty. The two covered
wagons were dilapidated, too. Gypsies usually
have good horses, but those the girls saw feeding
in the little glade were mere “crowbaits.”</p>

<p>Several low-browed, roughly dressed men sat
in a group on the grass playing cards. They
were smoking, and one was tipping a black bottle
to his lips just as the girls from Milton came
near.</p>

<p>“Let’s hurry right by, Pearl!” begged Ruth.</p>

<p>Pearl, however, was not as observant as the
Corner House girl. She failed to see danger in
the situation, or in the looks the disturbed men
cast upon the unprotected party of girls. As
several of the fellows rose, Pearl called to them:</p>

<p>“Where’s your Pythoness? Where is the
Queen of the Gypsies? We want our fortunes
told.”</p>

<p>One man—a tall fellow with a scarred face—turned
and shouted something in a strange tongue
at the tents. Ruth recognized the language in
which the woman had talked to the dark-faced girl
on the train.</p>

<p>And then, the next moment, Ruth caught sight
of the face of the very woman in question, peering
from between the flaps of one of the dingy
tents.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink09'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER IX—THE SPOONDRIFT BUNGALOW</a></h2>

<p>“I don’t think these are very nice looking men,
do you, Tess?” Dot seriously asked her sister as
the party halted before the Gypsy camp.</p>

<p>“Why, Dot!” gasped Tess. “That man <i>there</i>
is the very fellow who tried to steal Ruth’s
chickens!”</p>

<p>“Oh—o-o!”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is,” whispered the amazed Tess.
“He’s the young man Tom Jonah chased up on
to the henhouse roof.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the philosophical Dot, “he can’t
steal our chickens <i>here</i>.”</p>

<p>“Just the same I wish Tom Jonah was here
with us. I—I’d feel better about meeting him,”
confessed Tess.</p>

<p>The other girls did not hear this conversation
between the two youngest Kenways. Ruth and
Agnes, however, were really troubled by the meeting
with the Gypsies; the former was, in addition,
suspicious of the woman who had been on the
train with them.</p>

<p>This strange woman did not come out of the
tent. Indeed, almost at once she disappeared,
dropping the curtain. She did not wish to be
observed by the girls from Milton.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on!” cried the reckless Pearl.
“They’ll only ask us a dime each. ‘Cross their
palms with silver,’ you know. And they do tell
the <i>queerest</i> things sometimes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we’d better stop this afternoon,
Pearl,” ventured Ruth, as one of the rough
fellows drew nearer to the girls.</p>

<p>“Let the little ladies wait but a short time,”
said this man. “They will have revealed to them
all they wish to know.”</p>

<p>He had an ugly leer, and had Pearl looked at
him she would have been frightened by his expression.
But she was searching her chain-purse
for dimes. It did not look to Ruth Kenway as
though that purse would last long in the company
of these evil fellows.</p>

<p>Now the same tent flap was pushed aside again
and into the open hobbled an old crone. She
seemed to be a toothless creature, and leaned
upon a crutch. Gray strands of coarse hair
straggled over her wrinkled forehead. She had
a hump on her back—or seemed to have, for she
wore a long cloak, the bedraggled tail of which
touched the ground.</p>

<p>She hobbled across the lawn toward the girls.
Ruth watched her closely for, it seemed, she came
more hurriedly than seemed necessary.</p>

<p>A dog—one of the mongrels that infested the
camp—ran at her, and the old crone struck at the
creature with her crutch; he ran away yelping.
She was plainly more vigorous of arm than one
would have believed from her decrepit appearance.</p>

<p>The grinning fellows separated as the old hag
came forward. She did not speak to them, but
she was muttering to herself.</p>

<p>“Incantations!” whispered Pearl. “Isn’t she
enough to give you the delicious shudders? Oh!”</p>

<p>Pearl was evidently enjoying the adventure to
the full, but some of the girls besides Ruth and
Agnes, did not feel so very pleasant. When
one of the fellows took hold of Carrie Poole’s
wrist-watch with a grimy finger and thumb, she
screamed.</p>

<p>“Don’t fear, little lady,” said the tall, grim
man, and he struck the officious fellow with his
elbow in the ribs. “He means nothing harmful.
Here is Zaliska, the Queen of the Romany. She
is very old and very wise. She will tell you much
for a silver shilling; but she will tell you more for
two-bits.”</p>

<p>“He means a quarter,” said Pearl, explaining.
“But a quarter’s too much. Show her your
palms, girls. This is my treat. I have ten
dimes.”</p>

<p>The tall man had motioned his fellows back,
but they were arranged around the party of girls
in such a way that, no matter which way they
turned, one of the ruffians was right before them!</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth! I am frightened!” whispered
Agnes in her sister’s ear.</p>

<p>“Sh! don’t scare the children,” Ruth said, her
first thought for Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>The old crone hobbled directly to Ruth and put
out a brown claw. Ruth extended her own right
hand tremblingly. The hag was mumbling something
or other, but Ruth could not hear what she
said at first, the other girls were chattering so.</p>

<p>Then she noticed that the grip of the old Gypsy
was a firm one. The back of her hand seemed
wrinkled and puckered; but suddenly Ruth knew
that this was the effect of grease paint!</p>

<p>This was a made-up old woman—not a real old
woman, at all!</p>

<p>The discovery frightened the Corner House
girl almost as much as the rough men frightened
her. “Zaliska” was a disguised creature.</p>

<p>She clung to Ruth’s hand firmly when the girl
would have pulled it away, and now Ruth heard
her hiss:</p>

<p>“Get you away from this place. Get you away
with your friends—quick. And do not come back
at all.”</p>

<p>Ruth was shaking with hysterical terror. The
creature clung to her hand and mumbled this
warning over and over again.</p>

<p>“What’s she telling you, Ruth?” demanded the
hilarious Pearl.</p>

<p>“Trouble! trouble!” mumbled the supposed
fortune-teller, shaking her head, but accepting the
next girl’s dime.</p>

<p>Ruth whispered swiftly to Pearl: “Oh! let us
get out of here. These men mean to rob us—I
am sure.”</p>

<p>“They would not dare,” began the startled
Pearl.</p>

<p>Just then there was a creaking of heavy
wheels, and a voice shouting to oxen. The
Gypsies glanced swiftly and covertly at one another,
falling back farther from the vicinity of
the girls.</p>

<p>Indeed, several of them returned to the card
game. The fortune-teller mumbled her foolish
prophecies quickly. Into the glade, along a wood-path
from the thicker timber, came two spans of
oxen dragging three great logs. A pleasant-faced
young man swung the ox-goad and spoke
cheerily to the slow-moving, ponderous animals.</p>

<p>“Let’s go at once, Pearl!” begged Ruth.
“We’ll keep close to this lumberman. Dot and
Tess can ride on the logs.”</p>

<p>“Come on, girls! I think this old woman is
a faker,” cried Pearl. “She can’t even tell me
whether I’m going to marry a blond man, or a
brunette!”</p>

<p>“Don’t go yet, little ladies,” said the tall man,
suavely. “Zaliska can tell you much——”</p>

<p>“Let’s go, girls!” cried Carrie Poole, snatching
her hand away from the supposed old woman.</p>

<p>Ruth and Agnes had already seized their sisters
and were hurrying them toward the lumberman.</p>

<p>“Whoa, Buck! Whoa, Bright!” shouted the
teamster, cracking the whiplash before the leading
span of oxen. “Sh-h! Steady. What’s the
matter, girls?”</p>

<p>“Won’t you take us to the main road where we
can get the stage for Pleasant Cove?” cried Ruth.</p>

<p>“Sure, Miss. Going right there. Want to
ride?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir!” cried the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>“That will be great fun!” shouted some of the
others. “Come on!”</p>

<p>They clambered all over the logs, that were
chained together and swung from the axle of the
rear pair of wheels. The Gypsies began gathering
around and some of them muttered threateningly,
but the lumberman cracked his whip and
the oxen started easily.</p>

<p>“Cling on, girls!” advised the driver. “No
skylarking up there. Soon have you out to the
pike road. And you want to keep away from that
Gypsy camp. They are a tough lot—very different
from the crowd that camped there last
year and the year before. We farmers are getting
about ready to run them out, now I tell ye!”</p>

<p>Ruth said nothing—not even to Agnes—about
what she had discovered. She had penetrated
“Queen Zaliska’s” disguise. She believed that
the supposed old crone was the handsome, dark
girl whom she had observed so narrowly on the
train.</p>

<p>Perhaps nobody but Ruth, of the party of ten
girls, really understood that they had been in
peril from the Gypsies. <i>She</i> believed that, had
they not gotten away from the camp as they had,
the men would have robbed them.</p>

<p>The Gypsies were afraid of the husky lumberman,
and they did not follow the girls. Once on
the highway, Pearl declared the auto-stage would
be along in ten minutes or so, and they bade the
lumberman good-bye with a feeling of perfect
safety.</p>

<p>The Gypsies had not dared follow the party.
Soon the stage came along, and for ten cents each
the girls rode into Pleasant Cove. There were
only a few other passengers, and the party from
Milton sat on top and had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Pearl pointed out the byroad that led down to
the river beach where the tent colony was set up,
but the stage went right past Spoondrift bungalow,
and the girls got down and charged that
dwelling “like a horde of Huns,” Agnes declared.</p>

<p>Uncle Phillip Harrod was at home, and welcomed
them kindly. “Help yourselves, girls,
and go as far as you like,” he said, waving both
hands, and retired to a corner of the piazza with
his book and a pipe.</p>

<p>The girls took him at his word. They were
very busy till nightfall. Then, however,
everything was ready for their occupancy of the bungalow,
and supper was cooking on the kerosene
range.</p>

<p>They had forgotten the Gypsies—all but Ruth.
She was bound to be puzzled by the disguised
“queen” and wondered secretly what the masquerade
meant, and who the beautiful girl was
who posed as “Zaliska”?</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink10'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER X—SOME EXCITEMENT</a></h2>

<p>“But <i>why</i> ‘Spoondrift’?” demanded Lucy.
“What does it mean?”</p>

<p>“‘Spoondrift’ is the spray from the tops of the
waves,” explained Pearl. “We think the name
is awfully pretty.”</p>

<p>“And so is the bungalow—and the Cove,”
sighed Ruth.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to have a scrumptious time
here!” declared Agnes.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were frankly sleepy, and Lucy
begged the privilege of seeing them to bed.</p>

<p>“That’s real kind of you, I’m sure, Lute,” said
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Don’t you praise her,” sniffed Carrie. “I
know Lute. She’s sleepy, herself. You won’t
see her downstairs again to-night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” yawned Lucy Poole, following
Tess and Dot. “I sleep so slowly that it takes
a long time for me to get a good night’s rest.”</p>

<p>“Well! of all things!” ejaculated Carrie, as
her cousin departed, following the two smaller
girls. “What do you know about <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Almost as stupid as the inhabitants of London,”
chuckled Agnes.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Ag?” demanded
Ann Presby. “The people of London aren’t
any more stupid than those of other cities, are
they?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” returned Agnes; “but the
book says ‘the population of London is very
dense.’”</p>

<p>“Fine! fine!” cried Carrie Poole, laughing.
“Oh! these ‘literal’ folk. You know, my Grandfather
Poole has an awfully bald head. He was
telling us once that in some famous battle of the
Civil War in which he took part, his head was
grazed by a bullet. My little brother Jimmy
stared at his head thoughtfully for a minute, and
then he said:</p>

<p>“‘My, Grandpa, there’s not much grazing up
there now, is there?’”</p>

<p>These stories began the evening. Everybody
had some story or joke to relate, and finally the
girls began to guess riddles. Somebody propounded
the old one about the wind: “What
is it that goes all around the house and yet makes
no tracks?” and Agnes had a new answer for
it:</p>

<p>“Germs!” she shouted. “You know, Miss
Georgiana gave us a lecture about them, and I
bet we’re just surrounded by deadly bacilli right
now.”</p>

<p>“Those aren’t germs—they’re mosquitos,
Ag!” laughed Pearl, slapping vigorously at one
of the pests. “Pleasant Cove isn’t entirely free
from them.”</p>

<p>“And they are presenting their bills pretty
lively, too,” yawned Ruth. “The bedrooms are
screened. I believe we’d all better seek the haven
of bed unless we want to be splotchy to-morrow
from mosquito bites.”</p>

<p>In the morning the older girls divided the
housework between them, and so got it all done
in short order. The baggage had come up from
the station the evening before, and they unpacked.</p>

<p>Then they set forth to explore the fishing port,
as well as the more modern part of Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>As they brisked along the walk past Mr. Terrence
Severn’s Overlook House, they spied Trix
and her party on the big veranda. The girls
hailed each other back and forth; only Trix and
the Corner House girls did not speak.</p>

<p>“We can’t speak to her if she won’t speak to
us,” said Ruth to Agnes. “Now, never you
mind, Aggie. She’ll get over her tantrum in
time.”</p>

<p>The party from Spoondrift bungalow got back
in season to get luncheon; after which they rested
and then bathed. It was the Corner House girls’
first experience of salt water bathing and they
all enjoyed it—even Dot.</p>

<p>“It <i>does</i> make you suck in your breath awfully
hard when the waves lap upon you,” she confessed.
“But there was the Alice-doll sitting on
the shore watching me, and so I couldn’t let her
see that I was <i>afraid</i>!”</p>

<p>Ruth, more than the other girls, aided Pearl
in looking after housekeeping affairs. It was
she who discovered the broken lamp in the front
hall.</p>

<p>The bungalow was lighted by oil-lamps, and
they used candles in the bed chambers; while
there was a marvelous “blue-flame” kerosene
range in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Not all of the girls understood the handling of
kerosene lamps, and Pearl told a funny story
about her own little sister who had never seen
any lights but gas or electric.</p>

<p>“When she came down here to Uncle Phil’s
bungalow for the first time, she was all excited
about the lamps. She told mamma that ‘Uncle
Phil had his ’lectricity in a lamp right on the
supper table. It’s a queer kind of a light, for
they fill it with water out of a can.’”</p>

<p>The hanging lamp in the front hall was set
inside a melon-shaped globe. Finding that, as
Ruth pointed out, it could not be used, Pearl made
another trip to the village before teatime and in
the local “department store” bought another
lamp.</p>

<p>“I am afraid you ought not to use that lamp,
Pearl,” Ruth said, when she saw that the chimney
was not tall enough to stick out of the top of
the globe.</p>

<p>“Pooh! why not? Guess it’s just as good as
the old chimney was,” said Pearl.</p>

<p>“Seems to me Mrs. MacCall says that chimneys
should always be tall enough to come up
through the globe. I don’t know just why——”</p>

<p>“Oh, pshaw!” interrupted Pearl. “It’s all
right, I fancy.”</p>

<p>Neither girl had recourse to “applied physics.”
Had she done so she could easily have discovered
just <i>why</i> it was unwise to use a lamp with a short
chimney inside such a shaped globe as that hanging
in chains in the front hall of the bungalow.</p>

<p>Ruth forgot the matter. It was Pearl herself
who lit the hall lamp that evening. As before,
they sat on the porch and played games and sang
or told stories, all the long, bright evening.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot had gone to bed at half after
eight. It was an hour later that Lucy suddenly
said:</p>

<p>“I smell smoke.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t Mr. Harrod,” said Ann. “He’s gone
down to the Casino.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t tobacco smoke I smell,” declared
Lucy, springing up.</p>

<p>“Oh, Lute!” shrieked Agnes. “Look at the
door!”</p>

<p>A cloud of black, thick smoke was belching out
of the front hall upon the veranda. One of the
other girls shrieked “Fire!”</p>

<p>Those next few minutes were terribly exciting
for all hands at the Spoondrift bungalow. A
single glance into the hall showed Ruth Kenway
that the hanging lamp had burst, and the place
was all ablaze.</p>

<p>There was but one stairway, and the children
were in one of the low-ceilinged rooms above.
Tess and Dot could only be reached by climbing up
the long, sloping roof of the bungalow, and getting
in at the chamber window.</p>

<p>While some of the girls ran for water—which
was useless in the quantity they could bring from
the kitchen tap in pots and pans—and others ran
screaming along the street for help, Ruth “shinnied”
right up one of the piazza pillars and
squirmed out upon the shingled roof.</p>

<p>She tore her dress, and hurt her knees and
hands; but she did not think of this havoc at the
moment. She got to the window of the room in
which her sisters slept, and screamed for Tess
and Dot, but in their first sleep the smaller girls
were completely “dead to the world.”</p>

<p>There was the screen to be reckoned with before
the oldest Corner House girl could enter.
It was set into the window from the inside, and
she could neither lift the window-sash nor stir
the screen. So she beat the tough wire in with
her fists, and they bled and hurt her dreadfully!
Nevertheless, she got through, falling into the
room just as the stifling smoke from below began
to pour in around the bedroom door.</p>

<p>“Tess! Dot! Hurry up! Get up!” she
shrieked, shaking them both.</p>

<p>Tess aroused, whimpering. Ruth seized Dot
bodily, flung a blanket around her, and put her
out of the window upon the roof. Then she
dragged Tess to the window and made her climb
out after her sister.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” gasped Tess, alive at last to the
cause of the excitement. “Save the Alice-doll,
Ruthie. Save Dot’s Alice-doll!”</p>

<p>And Ruth actually went back, groping through
the gathering smoke, for the doll. With it she
scrambled out upon the shingles.</p>

<p>By that time the street was noisy with shouting
people. Mr. Harrod came with a fire extinguisher
and attacked the flames. Other men
came and helped the girls down from the roof.</p>

<p>Agnes had fainted when she realized the danger
her sisters were in. Some of the other girls
were quite hysterical. Neighbors took them all
in for the night.</p>

<p>It was quite an hour before the fire was completely
out. Then the Spoondrift bungalow certainly
was in a mess.</p>

<p>“It will take carpenters and painters a fortnight
and more to repair the damage,” said Mr.
Harrod the next morning. “Luckily none of
your guests lost their clothing, Pearl; but you
will all have to go to the hotel to finish your visit
to Pleasant Cove.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink11'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XI—THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE</a></h2>

<p>The Overlook House was nearest. Mr. Harrod
made arrangements for the girls to go there
and occupy several rooms. At least, he presumed
he had made that arrangement with Mr.
Severn when he left on the forenoon train for
Bloomingsburg to arrange his insurance and hire
mechanics to at once repair the bungalow.</p>

<p>The Spoondrift cottage was really not fit for
occupancy and there seemed nothing else for the
girls to do but follow his advice and go over to
the Overlook. But Ruth Kenway had her doubts.</p>

<p>After the excitement of the fire, and the general
“stir-about” which ensued, Pearl Harrod had
quite forgotten that the Corner House girls were
not on terms of intimacy with Trix Severn, the
hotel keeper’s daughter. It probably never entered
her good-natured mind that Trix would behave
meanly when all hands from the Spoondrift
had escaped the peril of the fire.</p>

<p>The girls trooped over to the hotel, after repacking
their baggage, to look at the rooms which
had been secured for them. Mr. Severn was not
there, nor was the clerk on duty. Their schoolmate,
Trix, was behind the desk.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” she said carelessly, “I presume we
can find rooms for you. But father doesn’t care
much to take in people who won’t stay the season
out—especially at this time of the year. It’s
a great inconvenience.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” said Pearl, frankly, “I guess your
father is running his hotel for money—not for
sport. And Uncle Phil is going to pay him for
all the accommodation we get.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?” returned Trix. “You seem to
know a lot about our business, Miss Harrod.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you put on any of your high and mighty
airs with me, Miss!” snapped Pearl. “For they
don’t go down, let me tell you! Didn’t Uncle
Phil secure rooms for us?”</p>

<p>“Well—he spoke of your coming here. There
is Number 10, and 11, and 14; they’re all three
double rooms, so you and Ann can have one,
Maud and Lulu another, and Carrie and Lucy the
third.”</p>

<p>“But, goodness gracious! there are ten of us!”
cried Pearl. “You know that very well.”</p>

<p>“Those three rooms,” said Trix, with elaborate
carelessness, “are all your uncle provided.”</p>

<p>“Why, Uncle Phil must be crazy! Didn’t he
get a big room for the Kenways?”</p>

<p>“Humph!” said Trix, maliciously. “Are <i>they</i>
with you, Miss Harrod? Your uncle must have
quite overlooked them. All the rooms I know
anything about his securing for your party are
the three I’ve mentioned.”</p>

<p>“Well, where’s your father——”</p>

<p>“He’s gone fishing,” said Trix, promptly, and
with a flash of satisfaction in her eyes. “He
won’t be back till late to-night.”</p>

<p>“Then, where’s the clerk?” demanded Pearl,
much worried.</p>

<p>“Mr. Cheever doesn’t know anything about it.
I was here when your uncle made his bargain.
Nothing was said about those Corner House girls—so
there! There is no room for them here.”</p>

<p>“Well! I call that the meanest thing!” began
Pearl, but Ruth, who had stood close by, interrupted:</p>

<p>“Don’t let it worry you in the least, Pearl.
We have plenty of time to find accommodations
before night.”</p>

<p>“You won’t find them here, Miss!” snapped
Trix.</p>

<p>“Nothing would make me remain under this
roof for a night,” said Ruth, indignantly. “My
sisters and I have never done you any harm,
Trix; quite the contrary, as you would remember
had you any gratitude at all. This hotel is not
the only place at Pleasant Cove where we can
find shelter, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth! don’t go!” begged Pearl. “This
mean girl is not telling the truth, I am sure.
You’ll break up our party,” Pearl wailed.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stay here now,” the oldest Corner
House girl declared. “I am going to secure a
tent for us. I am quite sure we will be
comfortable in one. If other people can stand it
under canvas, of course <i>we</i> can.”</p>

<p>She took Agnes by the hand and they went out
of the hotel. Tess and Dot had not come with
them, but had been left at the neighbor’s where
they had all spent the night.</p>

<p>Pearl and the other girls could not very well
follow them; they were not so independently situated
as the Corner House girls. Ruth had a
well filled pocket-book, as well as checks from
Mr. Howbridge and an introductory letter to the
branch bank at Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>She had been so used to going ahead, and arranging
matters for the whole family, during the
past three years, that she was not troubled much
by this emergency. She was sorry that the pleasant
party had to be broken up, that was all. She
was not sure that she and her sisters knew any
of the campers along the riverside.</p>

<p>There were two men who supplied tents and
outfits for those who wished to live under canvas,
and so there were two distinct tent colonies,
though they were side by side.</p>

<p>One was called Camp Enterprise, and the other
Camp Willowbend. The latter was just at the
bend of the river, and there were a few willows
on the low bluff back of it.</p>

<p>There were not more than a dozen tents erected
in either camp as yet, for it was early in the season.
The Corner House girls rode quite a mile
from the hotel to Willowbend Camp and selected
a tent that was already erected.</p>

<p>It was a large wall-tent and it was divided in
half by a canvas partition that made a bedroom
of one end and a living-room of the front part.
In the latter was a small sheetiron cookstove,
with a pipe that led the smoke outside of the tent.
But there was an oilstove, too, and Ruth decided
that they would make arrangements for buying
most of their food cooked, so as to reduce the
details of housekeeping.</p>

<p>Agnes cheered up at once when she saw the
tent-cities. And the smaller girls were delighted
with the prospect of living under canvas.</p>

<p>There were four cots in the tent, with sheets
and blankets, and apologies for pillows; there was
matting laid down on the sand, too, in this bedroom
part of the tent.</p>

<p>The remainder of the furnishings consisted of
four camp-chairs, a plain deal table, a chest of
drawers that contained the chinaware and cooking
utensils, and a small icebox. This front
apartment had a plank floor, made in sections.</p>

<p>It was a rough enough shelter, and the camping
arrangements were crude; nevertheless, the
Corner House girls saw nothing but fun ahead
of them, and they were as busy as bees all that
day “getting settled.”</p>

<p>There were pleasant people in the other tents
of Camp Willowbend, but none of them chanced
to be Milton people. There were several girls
of ages corresponding to those of the Corner
House girls, and the latter were sure they would
find these neighbors good sport.</p>

<p>The Kenways were so busy at noon that they
only “took a bite in their fists,” as good Mrs.
MacCall would have expressed it. Ruth had been
wise enough to buy some cooked food in the village
before they came over to the camp, but she
learned from some of the ladies in the tents that
there was a woman in the neighborhood who
baked bread to sell, and sometimes cookies and
pies.</p>

<p>“You go to see Mrs. Bobster. She’s the nicest
old lady!” declared one city matron. “Make
your arrangements for bread now, Miss Kenway,
for after she takes orders for as many as she can
well supply, she wouldn’t agree to bake another
loaf. She has a real New England conscience,
and she wouldn’t promise to bake a single biscuit
more than she knows she can get in her
oven.”</p>

<p>The directions for finding Mrs. Bobster interested
and amused the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>“She is the little old woman who lives in the
shoe,” laughed their informant. “You can’t
miss the house, if you go along the beach road
toward town. It’s just beyond the other camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Dot, eagerly, “<i>I</i> want to see the
lady who lives in a shoe. She must have lots of
children, for they were a great bother.”</p>

<p>“And,” said Tess, “do you suppose she <i>does</i>
whip them all soundly and send them to bed with
a piece of bread to eat?”</p>

<p>“We’ll discover all that,” promised Ruth, and
soon after luncheon, having fixed up the tent, and
set to rights their things that the expressman had
brought over from the Spoondrift bungalow, the
four sisters set out to find Mrs. Bobster.</p>

<p>The girls had ridden over from the village
along the highroad, on which they had traveled
two days before in the auto-stage. This lower,
or “beach” road was a much less important
thoroughfare. In places it followed the line of
the shore so closely that the unusual high tides
that had prevailed that spring, had washed a
great deal of white sand across the swamp-grass
and out upon it.</p>

<p>So, in places, the girls plodded through sand
over their shoe tops. “Might as well go barefooted,”
declared Agnes, sitting down for the
third time to take off her oxfords and shake out
the sand.</p>

<p>“You’d find it pretty different, if you tried it,”
laughed Ruth. “This sand is hot.”</p>

<p>“It does seem as though you slipped back half
a step each time you tried to go forward,” said
Tess, seriously. “Aren’t we ever going to get
there, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Dot, suddenly, “isn’t that a giraffe?
And there’s a camel!”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake!” gasped Agnes,
plunging to her feet, and hopping along after her sisters,
trying to get on her left shoe. “Is this the
African desert?”</p>

<p>“It looks like it,” said Ruth, herself amazed.</p>

<p>“And it’s hot enough,” grumbled Agnes.
“Oh! I see! it’s a wrecked carousel.”</p>

<p>There were decrepit lions and tigers, too; the
rain-washed and broken animals were the remains
of a carousel, the machinery of which had been
taken away. Once somebody had tried to finance
a small pleasure resort between the real village
of Pleasant Cove and the two tent colonies, but
it had been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The wreck of a “shoot the chutes,” the carousel,
a dancing pavilion and a short boardwalk
with adjacent stands, had been abandoned by the
unfortunate promoters. There was a tower—now
a “leaning” tower; broken-down swings; an
abandoned moving picture palace; and back from
the rest of the wreckage, several hundred yards
from the sandy shore, the girls saw a rusty looking
frame structure, shaped like a shoe, with a
flagstaff sticking out of the roof.</p>

<p>“There it is!” cried Tess, eagerly. “And it
<i>does</i> look like a shoe.”</p>

<p>Originally the house had been a tiny brown
cottage set in the midst of a garden. The fence
surrounding the place was still well kept. The
second story of the cottage had been transformed
into the semblance of a congress-gaiter, with windows
in the sides and front. It looked as though
that huge shoe had been carefully placed upon the
rafters of the first floor rooms of the cottage.</p>

<p>“What a funny looking place!” exclaimed
Agnes. “Did you ever see the like, Ruth? I
wonder if Mrs. Bobster is as funny as her
house.”</p>

<p>At that moment a figure bobbed up among the
beanpoles in the garden, and the girls saw that
it was a little woman in a calico sunbonnet. Her
face was very small and hard and rosy—like
a well-shined Baldwin apple. She had twinkling
blue eyes, as sharp as file-points.</p>

<p>“Shoo!” exclaimed the little woman. “Shoo,
Agamemnon! Git aout o’ them pea-vines like I
told you!”</p>

<p>For a moment the Corner House girls did not
see Agamemnon; they could not imagine who he
was.</p>

<p>“Shoo, I tell ye!” exclaimed the little old
woman who lived in a shoe, and she struck out
with the short-handled hoe she was using.</p>

<p>There was a squawk, and out leaped, with awkward
stride, a long legged rooster—of what “persuasion”
it was impossible to tell, for he was
swathed from neck to spurs in a wonderful garment
which had undoubtedly been made out of a
red flannel undershirt!</p>

<p>Two or three bedraggled tail-feathers appeared
at the aperture in the back of this garment; otherwise
Agamemnon seemed to be quite featherless.
And when, clear of his mistress’ reach, he flapped
his almost naked wings and crowed, he was the
most comical looking object the Corner House
girls had ever seen.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink12'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XII—A PICNIC WITH AGAMEMNON</a></h2>

<p>“You see, gals, Agamemnon’s been the most
unlucky bird that ever was hatched,” said the little
old woman, coming across the tiny lawn to the
fence where the Corner House girls were staring,
round-eyed, at the strange apparition of a
rooster in a red-flannel sleeping-suit.</p>

<p>“But he’s the pluckiest! Yes, ma’am! He
was only a pindling critter when he pipped the
shell, an’ the vi-cis-<i>si</i>-tudes that bird’s been
through since he fust scratched would ha’ made
a human lay right down and die.</p>

<p>“The other chickens never would let him raise
a pin-feather ter cover his nakedness; they picked
on him suthin’ <i>awful</i>. I shet him up till his
wings and tail growed, an’ a rat got in an’ gnawed
the feathers right off him in one night; but
Agamemnon picked and clawed so’t the old rat
didn’t bleed him much.</p>

<p>“And now here, lately, a neighbor got a half-breed
game rooster, an’ thet pesky fightin’ bird
got down here an’ sasses Agamemnon on his own
premises.</p>

<p>“Ag wouldn’t stand for that,” said the old
lady, her blue eyes fairly crackling. “He sailed
right inter that game chicken—an’ Neighbor
Lincoln et his rooster the nex’ Sunday for dinner.
’Twas all he could do with the critter after
Agamemnon got through with him.</p>

<p>“But that game rooster had tore ev’ry <i>important</i>
feather off’n poor Agamemnon’s carcass.
I had to do suthin’. ’Twarn’t decent for him to
go ’round bare. So I made him that smock out
of one o’ poor Eddie’s old shirts. And there ye
be!” she finished breathlessly, smiling broadly
upon the interested Corner House girls.</p>

<p>“I guess you are Mrs. Bobster?” asked Ruth,
smiling in return.</p>

<p>“Are you <i>really</i> the—the lady who lives in the
shoe?” asked Dot, round-eyed.</p>

<p>“That’s what they call me, pet,” said Mrs.
Bobster, smiling at the smallest Kenway. “I’m
the only little old woman who lives in <i>this</i> shoe.
Poor Eddie thought we’d make a mint of money
if we built over the top of our house like that,
and I sold gingercakes and sweeties to the children
who came down here to the beach. Eddie
was allus mighty smart in thinkin’ up schemes
for me to make money. But the Beach Company
went up in smoke, as the sayin’ is; so we didn’t
make our fortun’ after all.”</p>

<p>She laughed. Indeed, this little, apple-faced old
lady was almost always laughing, it seemed.</p>

<p>“Poor Eddie!” she added. “I guess the
Beach Company failin’ took about all the tuck
out o’ him. He said himself it was the last straw
on the camel’s back. He jest settled right down
inter his chair, like; and he didn’t last that winter
out. He was allus weakly, Eddie was.”</p>

<p>The Corner House girls knew she must be
speaking of her husband. So now she was all
alone in the house that had such a grotesque upper
story.</p>

<p>“No. There ain’t no children here—only them
that comes in to see me,” Mrs. Bobster said in
answer to a question from Tess. “We never did
have no children; but we allus loved ’em.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile she had opened the gate and invited
the Corner House girls into the yard.
There was an arbor which was already shaded
by quick-growing vines. The little kitchen garden,
with its border of gooseberries and currants,
was as neat as it could be.</p>

<p>“I gotter cow of my own out back, and hens,
too. I make a bare livin’ in winter, and put frills
onto it in summer,” and the old lady laughed.
“These folks from the city that come livin’ in
tents here, like my bread and cookies.”</p>

<p>“That is what we have come to arrange for,
Mrs. Bobster,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“I dunno. Most all I can comferbly bake three
times a week, is bespoke,” said the little old
woman who lived in a shoe. “How many is
there in your fam’bly, Miss?”</p>

<p>When she heard that there were just four of
them—these girls alone—and that they were to
live by themselves in a tent, she grew greatly interested.</p>

<p>“Surely I’ll bake for you—and cookies, too.
Maybe a fruit pie oncet in a while—’specially if
you’ll go over beyond the bend when berries is
ripe and pick ’em yourself. And you gals a-livin’
all alone? Sho! I’d think you’d be scaret to
death.”</p>

<p>“Why, no!” said Ruth. “Why should we?”</p>

<p>“After dark,” said the old woman, shaking her
hand.</p>

<p>“Who would hurt us?” asked the Corner House
girl in wonder.</p>

<p>“Can’t most always sometimes tell,” said the
old woman, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“But <i>you</i> live here alone!”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, quickly. “Not after dark. I
ain’t never alone. Oh, no!”</p>

<p>She spoke as though she were afraid Ruth
might not believe her, and repeated the denial
several times.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were very anxious to go upstairs
and see the rooms in the “shoe,” and they made
the request to Ruth in an audible whisper.</p>

<p>“For sure!” cried Mrs. Bobster. “All the
children that come here want to go upstairs. If
I had ’em of my own, that’s where I’d put ’em
all to bed after I’d fed ’em bread and ‘whipped
’em all soundly,’” and she laughed.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you’d have whipped the children,
if you’d been the really truly little old
woman that lived in the shoe,” quoth Dot, putting
a confiding hand into the apple-faced lady’s
hard palm.</p>

<p>“I bet <i>you</i> wouldn’t have had to be whipped,”
laughed Mrs. Bobster, leading Dot away, with
Tess following.</p>

<p>Later the hostess of the shoe-house brought out
a pitcher of milk and glasses with a heaping plate
of ginger cookies—the old-fashioned kind that
just <i>melt</i> on your tongue!</p>

<p>“Sho!” she said, when Ruth praised them.
“It’s easy enough to make good merlasses cookies.
But ye don’t wanter have no conscience
when it comes to butter—no, indeed!”</p>

<p>Agamemnon came to the feast. In his ridiculous
red flannel suit he waddled up to his mistress
and pecked crumbs off her lap when she sat
down on the bench in the arbor.</p>

<p>“He looks just like a person ready to go in
swimming,” chuckled Agnes. “It’s a red bathing
suit.”</p>

<p>“That’s one thing Agamemnon can’t stand.
He don’t like water,” said Mrs. Bobster. “But
if I let him out at low tide he’ll beau a flock of
hens right down to the clamflats. But now, poor
thing! they won’t go with him.”</p>

<p>“Who—the hens!” asked Ruth, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Yes. They don’t think he looks jest right,
I s’pose. If he chassés up to one of my old biddies,
she tries to tear that flannel suit right off’n
him. It’s hard on poor Agamemnon; but until
his feathers start to grow good again, I don’t
dare have him go without it. He’d git sunburned
like a brick, in the fust place.”</p>

<p>This tickled Agnes so that she almost fell off
the bench.</p>

<p>“But I should think the red flannel would tickle
him awfully,” murmured Tess, quite seriously
disturbed over the plight of the rooster.</p>

<p>“Sho! keeps away rheumatics. So poor Eddie
allus said,” declared the widow. “That’s why
he wore red flannel for forty year—and he never
had a mite of rheumatism. Agamemnon ought
to be satisfied he’s alive, after all he’s been
through.”</p>

<p>It was really very funny to see the rooster
strutting about the yard in what Agnes called
his red bathing suit.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls remained for some
time with Mrs. Bobster. When they went back
to the camp at the bend they carried their first
supply of bread and cookies.</p>

<p>They arrived at their tent to find a wagonette
Pearl had hired in the port, and all the other girls
who had been at the Spoondrift bungalow had
come visiting.</p>

<p>The crowd was delighted with the way Ruth
and her sisters were situated. It looked as
though to live under canvas would be great fun
indeed.</p>

<p>“Wish I’d spoken to Uncle Phil about it, and
gotten him to hire tents instead of putting us up
at that old hotel,” declared Pearl. “And do you
know, girls, that Trix Severn told a story?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose she’d be above being untruthful,”
Ruth said, rather indignantly.</p>

<p>“And you’re quite right. We found out that
her father set aside a big, double-bedded room
for you four girls. Trix says she did not know
anything about it. But of course Uncle Phil
would not have forgotten you.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said Agnes. “I’m glad she
acted so. We’re a whole lot better off here.”</p>

<p>“I believe you!” said Carrie Poole.</p>

<p>“You going to have Rosa Wildwood here in the
tent with you when she comes?” asked Ann
Presby.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid she ought to have a better place,”
said Ruth. “And I believe I know just where she
would get the attention—and food—that she
needs,” and the oldest Corner House girl told
the crowd about Mrs. Bobster—the little old lady
who lived in a shoe.</p>

<p>“If I can get the dear old thing to take Rosa
to board, I know she’ll give her just what she
needs—good food, plenty of it, well cooked, and
Rosa will be in a quiet place where she can rest
all she wants to,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>She had no idea at the time of the strange adventure
that would arise out of this plan of
hers to bring Rosa Wildwood to stay for a part
of the summer with the little old woman who lived
in a shoe.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink13'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIII—THE NIGHT OF THE BIG WIND</a></h2>

<p>“Ruthie! there’s another man wants to sell you
a boat.”</p>

<p>“Ruthie! there’s another man wants to sell an
elephant—and it’s <i>so</i> cute!”</p>

<p>“For the land’s sake!” gasped Ruth, throwing
down a sputtering pen, where she was writing on
the chest of drawers in the tent. “<i>How</i> can a
body write? And an elephant, no less!”</p>

<p>She rushed out to see Dot’s elephant, as that
seemed more important than Tess’ announcement
that a man had merely a boat for sale.
Dot’s man was a gangling young fellow with a
covered basket from which he was selling sugar
cakes made into fancy shapes. So Dot had her
elephant for the Alice-doll (almost everything
that appealed to Dot was bought for that pampered
child of hers!) and was appeased.</p>

<p>But the man with the boat was a different matter.
He proved to be a boat owner and he wanted
to hire one of his craft to the Corner House girls
by the week. Agnes was just crazy (so she said)
to add rowing to her accomplishments, and Ruth
thought it would be a good thing herself.</p>

<p>The boat was a safe, cedar craft, with two pairs
of light oars and a portable kerosene engine and
propeller to use if the girls got tired of rowing.
Ruth made the bargain after thoroughly looking
over the boat, which had had only one season’s
use.</p>

<p>There was a chain and padlock for mooring it
to a post at the edge of the water just below the
tent.</p>

<p>The older girls had already learned to swim
in the school gymnasium at Milton. Milton was
pretty well up to date in its school arrangements.</p>

<p>Tess had been taught to “strike out” and could
be left safely to paddle by herself in shallow
water while Ruth and Agnes taught little Dot.</p>

<p>The latter refused to own to any fear of the
water. Up here in the river the waves were seldom
of any consequence, and of course on stormy
days the girls would not go bathing at all.</p>

<p>Others of the Willowbend campers had rowboats
for the season; and some even owned their
own motorboats. The girls were well advised regarding
fishing-tackle and the like. Crabbing
was a favorite sport just then, for several small
creeks emptied into the river nearby and soft-shell
crabs and shedders were plentiful.</p>

<p>“I’d be afraid of these crabs if their teeth were
hard,” Dot declared, for she insisted that the
“pincers” of the crustaceans were teeth.</p>

<p>“They are dreadfully <i>squirmy</i>, anyway,”
sighed Tess. “Just like spiders. And yet, we
eat them!”</p>

<p>“But—but I always shut my eyes when I eat
them; just as I do when I swallow raw oysters,”
confessed Dot. “They taste so much better than
they look!”</p>

<p>Having the boat, the Corner House girls rowed
to the village for their supplies and to visit their
friends. They did not go to the Overlook House;
but Pearl Harrod and her party were at the
burned bungalow almost all day. They always
bathed there, and the Corner House girls went
down to bathe with them. The beach was better
there than at the camp.</p>

<p>It was Monday when Ruth Kenway and her sisters
were established in their tent. On Thursday
of that week they rowed over to Spoondrift
bungalow in the morning. Pearl greeted them
before they got ashore with:</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth! The funniest thing has happened.
You’d never guess.”</p>

<p>“Trix Severn has the mumps!” exclaimed
Agnes. “I knew she was all swelled up.”</p>

<p>“Not as good as <i>that</i>,” laughed Pearl. “But
worse may happen to that girl than mumps.
However, it’s nothing to do with Trix.”</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Ruth, calmly. “I’m not
a good guesser, Pearl.”</p>

<p>“You remember those Gypsies?”</p>

<p>“That are camped up in the woods!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“If they <i>are</i> Gypsies,” said Ruth, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Of course they are!” cried Pearl. “Well,
they’ve been around here looking for you.”</p>

<p>“For goodness’ sake!” gasped Agnes. “What
for?”</p>

<p>Ruth herself looked startled. But Pearl began
to laugh again.</p>

<p>“At least, that queer old woman has been asking
for you,” she explained.</p>

<p>“Zaliska!” exclaimed Ruth, although she was
very sure that was not the person’s name. Of
course the name was part of the strange girl’s
masquerade.</p>

<p>“It was this morning,” Pearl went on to say.
“We didn’t see many of the women of the tribe
when we came past that camp last week. But a
number of them came down into the village this
morning—selling baskets and telling fortunes
from door to door. We saw them over by the
hotel—didn’t we, girls?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I bought a basket from one of them,”
admitted Carrie Poole.</p>

<p>“But when we came up here to the bungalow,”
pursued Pearl, “one of the men working here
asked me if I’d seen ‘my friend, the Gypsy
queen’? So, I said ‘No,’ of course.</p>

<p>“Then he told me that that Zaliska had asked
him where the girl was who was called Ruth Kenway.
He told her that after the bungalow got
afire, all the girls went to the hotel.”</p>

<p>“Then she’ll never find you there, Ruth,” interposed
Agnes, with satisfaction.</p>

<p>Ruth was not sure that she did not wish the
supposed Gypsy queen to find her. She knew
that “Zaliska” was really the very pretty, dark-skinned
girl whom she had been so much interested
in on the train coming down from Milton.</p>

<p>And that strange girl was interested in Rosa
Wildwood. Of that Ruth was as sure as she
could be.</p>

<p>“Maybe she’ll follow you up to the camp,”
said Lucy Poole. “I’d be afraid to live all alone
in that tent if I were you girls.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” exclaimed Agnes. “What’s going
to hurt us!”</p>

<p>“The crabs might come up the beach at night
and pinch your toes,” laughed Maud Everts.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Pearl said, seriously. “I
wouldn’t want those Gyps interested in <i>me</i>.”</p>

<p>“Now you are trying to frighten us,” laughed
Ruth. “We have plenty of neighbors. Don’t
you come up there and try to play tricks on us
in the tent. You might get hurt.”</p>

<p>“Bet she has a gatling gun,” chuckled Carrie
Poole.</p>

<p>“I’m going to have something better than
that,” declared Ruth, smiling. But she refused
to tell them <i>what</i>.</p>

<p>Ruth remembered that the little old woman who
lived in a shoe had spoken of being afraid, too;
so the oldest Corner House girl made her plans
accordingly, but kept them to herself.</p>

<p>After their bath the sisters dressed in the
Harrod tent that had been pitched on the lawn behind
the bungalow, and then went on to the village.
Ruth and Agnes rowed very nicely, for the
former, at least, had had some practise at this
sport before coming to Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>They tied the painter of their boat to a ring
in one of the wharf stringers, and went “up
town” to the stores. The village of Pleasant
Cove was never a bustling business center.
There were but few people on the main street,
and most of those were visitors.</p>

<p>“There are two of those Gypsy women, Ruth!”
hissed Agnes in her sister’s ear, as they came
out of a store.</p>

<p>Ruth looked up to see the woman who had been
in the train, and another. They were both humbly
dressed, but in gay colors. Ruth looked up
and down the street for the disguised figure of
the young girl, but <i>she</i> was not in sight.</p>

<p>“My goodness, Ruth!” said Agnes, “what do
you suppose that old hag of a Gypsy wants you
for?”</p>

<p>“She isn’t——” began Ruth. Then she
thought better of taking Agnes into her confidence
just then and did not finish her impulsively
begun speech, but said:</p>

<p>“We won’t bother about it. She probably
won’t find us up at Willowbend Camp.”</p>

<p>“I should hope <i>not</i>!” cried Agnes. “I don’t
want to get any better acquainted with those
Gyps.”</p>

<p>The matter, however, caused Ruth to think
more particularly of Rosa Wildwood. She had
not yet found a boarding place for the Southern
girl, and Rosa was to come down to Pleasant
Cove the next Monday.</p>

<p>Ruth wanted to see Mrs. Bobster, and she did
so that very afternoon. On their way back to
the camp they tied the boat up at the foot of the
wrecked pleasure park and walked up the broken
boardwalk to the shoe-house.</p>

<p>“Here’s your bread, girls—warm from the
oven,” said the brisk little woman. “And if you
want a pan of seed cookies——”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t we, just!” sighed Agnes.</p>

<p>The girls sat down to eat some of the delicacies
right then and there, and Mrs. Bobster brought
a pitcher of cool milk from the well-curb. Ruth
at once opened the subject of getting board for
Rosa with the little old woman who lived in a
shoe.</p>

<p>“Wal, I re’lly don’t know what ter say to ye,”
declared Mrs. Bobster. “I ain’t never kalkerlated
ter run a boardin’ house——</p>

<p>“But one young lady! I dunno. They wanted
me to take old Mr. Kendricks ter board last winter;
the town selectmen did. But I told ’em ‘No.’
I warn’t runnin’ a boardin’ house—nor yet the
poorfarm.”</p>

<p>“Poorfarm?” questioned Ruth, puzzled by the
reference.</p>

<p>“Yep. Ye see, there ain’t been no town poor
here in Pleasant Cove for a number o’ years.
Last winter old Mr. Kendricks see fit to let the
town board him. He’s spry enough to go clammin’
in the summer; an’ he kin steer a boat when
his rheumatics ain’t so bad. But winters is
gittin’ hard on him.</p>

<p>“It didn’t seem good jedgment,” Mrs. Bobster
said, reflectively, “to open the poorfarm jest for
<i>him</i>. B’sides, they’d got the old farm let to good
advantage for another year to Silas Holcomb.
So they come to me.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Kendricks is as nice an old man as
ever you’d wish ter see,” pursued Mrs. Bobster.
“He comes of good folks—jest as good as my
poor Eddie’s folks.</p>

<p>“The town selectmen had consid’rable trouble
gettin’ Mr. Kendricks took, ’count o’ his being so
pertic’lar. Yeast bread seemed ter be his chief
objection. He couldn’t make up his mind to it
on account of havin’ had sour milk biscuit all his
life; but finally, after I’d said ‘No,’ they got Mis’
Ann ’Liza Cobbles to agree to give him hot bread
three times a day like he was used to.</p>

<p>“But, lawsy me! She ain’t a com-<i>plete</i> cook—no,
indeed! Mr. Kendricks said her cookin’
warn’t up to the mark, an’ if he has to go on the
town this comin’ winter he shouldn’t go to Mis’
Cobbles.</p>

<p>“The selectmen may be driv’ to open the poorfarm
ag’in, an’ to gittin’ somebody ter do for Mr.
Kendricks proper.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a sort of lesson to the folks of
Pleasant Cove,” sighed Mrs. Bobster, “for bein’
sort o’ proud-like through reason of not havin’
no town poor for endurin’ of ten years. I view
it that way myself.</p>

<p>“Mr. Kendricks says he feels as if he was
meant ter be a notice to ’em; ter be ready an’
waitin’ ter help people in a proper way; not to
be boardin’ of ’em ’round where they might git
dyspepsia fastened on ’em through eatin’ of unproper
food.”</p>

<p>Agnes was giggling; but Ruth managed to get
the talkative old lady back into the track she
wanted her in. The Corner House girl expatiated
upon how little trouble Rosa would be,
and what a nice girl she was.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Mrs. Bobster, “I might try her.
You offer awful temptin’ money, Miss. And
poor Eddie allus said I’d do anything for
money!”</p>

<p>It had been fortunate for the deceased Mr.
Bobster, as Ruth had learned, that his wife <i>had</i>
been willing to earn money in any honest way;
for Mr. Bobster himself seldom had done a day’s
work after his marriage to the brisk little woman.</p>

<p>So the matter of Rosa Wildwood’s board and
lodging was arranged, and the Kenways went
back to their boat. Evening was approaching,
and with it dark clouds had rolled up from the
horizon, threatening a bad night.</p>

<p>Ruth and Agnes found a head wind to contend
with when they pushed off the cedar boat. Ruth
had learned to run the little motor propeller, and
she started it at once. Otherwise they would
have a hard time pulling up to Willowbend
Camp.</p>

<p>During the week there were few men at the
tent colonies. On Saturdays and Sundays the
husbands and fathers were present in force; but
now there was not a handful of adult males in
either the Enterprise or Willowbend encampments.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls were helped ashore,
however, and they hauled their boat clear up to
the front of their tent. There was quite a swell
on, and the waves ran far up the beach, hissing
and spattering spray into the air. The wind
swept this spray against the tents in gusts, like
rain.</p>

<p>But there was no rain—only wind. The black
clouds threatened, but there was no downpour.
There was no such thing as having a coal fire,
however; the wind blew right down the stack and
filled the tent with choking smoke.</p>

<p>They lit a lantern and ate a cold supper. The
flaps of the tent were laced down, for they had
been warned against letting the wind get under.
Now and then, however, a chill draught blew over
them and the partition creaked.</p>

<p>“It’s just like a storm at sea,” said Agnes,
rather fearfully, yet enjoying the novel sensation.
“We might as well be on a sailing ship.”</p>

<p>“Not much!” exclaimed Ruth. “At least,
we’re on an even keel.”</p>

<p>They agreed to go to bed early. Lying in the
cots, well covered with the blankets, seemed the
safest place on such a night. There was no shouting
back and forth from tent to tent, and no
visiting.</p>

<p>Lights went out early. The wind shrieked in
the treetops back from the shore, and in the lulls
the girls could hear the breakers booming on the
rocks outside the cove.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot went to sleep—tired with the
day’s activities. Not so the older girls. They
lay and listened, and shivered as the booming
voice of the wind grew in volume, and the water
seemed to drive farther and farther up the
beaches.</p>

<p>Forever after, this night was known at Pleasant
Cove as “the night of the big wind.” But as
yet it had only begun and the Corner House girls
had no idea of what was in store for them.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink14'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIV—AN IMPORTANT ARRIVAL</a></h2>

<p>Agnes <i>did</i> fall asleep; but Ruth only dozed, if
she closed her eyes at all. The rumble of the
storm shook the nerves of the oldest Corner
House girl—and no wonder!</p>

<p>Ruth felt the weight of responsibility for her
sisters’ safety. If anything happened while they
were under canvas she knew that she would be
blamed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the spray swept in from the river
and spattered on the canvas like a drenching
shower. The walls of the tent shook. She heard
many sounds without that she could not explain—and
some of these sounds frightened her.</p>

<p>Suppose the tent should blow down? The way
the wind sometimes shook it reminded Ruth of a
dog shaking a bit of rag.</p>

<p>Then, when the wind held its breath for a
moment, the roaring of the sea in the distance
was a savage sound to which the girl’s ears were
not attuned.</p>

<p>She had left the lantern lit and it swung from
a rope tied to the ridgepole of the tent, and beyond
the half partition of canvas. Its flickering
light cast weird shadows upon the canvas roof.</p>

<p>Now and then the spray beat against the front
of the tent, while the roof shook and shivered as
though determined to tear away from the walls.
Ruth wished she had gone all around the tent
before dark to make sure the pegs were driven
well into the sand.</p>

<p>Occasionally children cried shrilly, for the
noise of the elements frightened them; Ruth was
thankful that Tess and Dot slept on.</p>

<p>She slept herself at last; how long she did not
know, for when she awoke she was too greatly
frightened to look at her watch. The wind
seemed suddenly to have increased. It seemed
struggling to tear the tent up by the roots!</p>

<p>And as the canvas shook, and swelled, and
strove to burst its fastenings, there came a sudden
snap on one side and one of the pegs flew
high in the air at the end of its rope, coming
down slap on the roof of the tent!</p>

<p>“The peg has pulled out!” gasped Ruth, sitting
up in her cot and throwing off the blanket.</p>

<p>The canvas was straining and bellying fearfully
at the point where the peg had drawn. It
was likely to draw the pegs on either side. Ruth
very well knew that if a broad enough opening
was made for the wind to get under, the tent
would be torn from its fastenings.</p>

<p>She hopped out upon the matting and shook
Agnes by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Get up! Get up, Ag!” she called, breathlessly.
“Help me.”</p>

<p>She ran to the front of the tent for the maul—a
long-handled, heavy-headed croquet-mallet.
When she returned with it, Agnes was trying to
rub her eyes open.</p>

<p>“Come quick, Ag! We’ll be blown away,” declared
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I—I——What’ll we do?” whimpered Agnes.</p>

<p>“We must hold the tent down. Come on! Get
into your mackintosh. I’ll get the lantern.”</p>

<p>Around the upright pole in the sleeping part
of the tent were hung the girls’ outer garments.
Ruth got into her own raincoat and buttoned it
to her ankles. She left Agnes struggling with
hers while she ran to unhang the lantern. She
knew the night must be as black as a pocket outside.</p>

<p>“Wha—what you going to do?” stuttered
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Drive the pegs in deeper. One of them pulled
out.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! <i>Can</i> we?”</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to, if we don’t want to
lose our tent. Hear that wind?”</p>

<p>“It—it sounds like cannon roaring.”</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t the front flap——”</p>

<p>“Think I’m going to unlace that front flap
when the wind’s blowing right into it?”</p>

<p>“Can’t we get out yonder, where the peg has
been pulled?”</p>

<p>“But how’ll we get in again when all the stakes
are driven down hard?” snapped Ruth, beginning
to unlace the flaps of the rear wall of the tent.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” moaned Agnes. “Hear that
wind?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t care if it only <i>hollered</i>,” gasped
Ruth. “It’s what it will do if it ever gets under
this tent, that troubles me!”</p>

<p>She unlaced the flaps only a little way. “Come
along with that lantern, Ag. We’ve got to crawl
under.”</p>

<p>“‘Get down and get under,’” giggled Agnes,
hysterically.</p>

<p>But she brought the lantern and followed Ruth
out of the tent, on hands and knees. When they
stood up and tried to go around to that side of
the tent where the peg had pulled out, the wind
almost knocked them down.</p>

<p>“And how the sleet cuts!” gasped Agnes, her
arm across her eyes for protection.</p>

<p>“It’s sand,” explained Ruth. “I thought it
was spray from the river. But a good deal of it
is sand—just like a sand-storm in the desert.”</p>

<p>“Well!” grumbled Agnes, “I hope it’s killing
a lot of those sandfleas that bother us so. I don’t
see how they can live and be blown about this
way.”</p>

<p>Ruth tackled the first post at the corner and
beat it down as hard as she could, Agnes holding
the lantern so that the older girl could see where
to strike.</p>

<p>They went from one peg to the next, taking
each in rotation. And when they reached the one
that had pulled out entirely, Ruth drove that into
the ground just as far as it would go.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, throughout all this business,
Tess and Dot did not awake. Ruth went clear
around the tent, driving the stakes. The wind
howled; the sand and spray blew; and the voices
of the Night and of the Storm seemed fairly to
yell at them. Still the smaller Corner House
girls slept through it all. Ruth and Agnes crept
back into the tent and laced the flaps down in
safety.</p>

<p>A little later, before either of them fell asleep
again, they heard shouting and confusion at a
distance. In the morning they learned that two
of the tents in the Enterprise Camp had blown
down.</p>

<p>The shore was strewn with wreckage, too, when
daybreak came; but the wind seemed to have
blown itself out. Many small craft had come
ashore, and some were damaged. It was not
often that the summer visitors at Pleasant Cove
saw any such gale as this had been.</p>

<p>Everything was all right with the Corner
House girls, and Ruth decided they would stick
to the tent, in spite of the fact that some of the
camping families were frightened away from the
tent colonies by this disgraceful exhibition of
Mr. Wind!</p>

<p>The smaller Kenways, as well as the bigger
girls, were enjoying the out-of-door life immensely.
They were already as brown as berries.
They ran all day, bare-headed and bare-legged,
on the sands. It was plain to be seen that
the change from Milton to Pleasant Cove was doing
all the Corner House girls a world of good.</p>

<p>And during the extremely pleasant days that
immediately followed the night of the big wind,
many new colonists came to the tents. Two big
tents were erected in the Willowbend Camp, for
Joe Eldred and <i>his</i> friends—and that included,
of course, Neale O’Neil. But the Milton boys
would not arrive until the next week.</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon the Corner House girls
walked down to the railroad station to greet Rosa
Wildwood. It had been a very hot day in town
and it was really hot at Pleasant Cove, as well.</p>

<p>“Oh! you poor thing!” gasped Ruth, receiving
Rosa in her strong arms as she stumbled off
the car steps with her bag.</p>

<p>“I’m as thin as the last run of shad, am I not?”
asked Rosa, laughing. “That train was <i>awful</i>!
I am baked. It’s never like this down South.
The air is so much dryer there; there isn’t this
humidity. Oh!”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re here all right now, Rosa,” cried
Ruth. “We have a nice, easy carriage for you
to ride in. And the <i>dearest</i> place for you to
live!”</p>

<p>“And scrumptious eating, Rose,” added Agnes.</p>

<p>“With the little old woman who lives in a
shoe,” declared Tess, eager to add her bit of information.</p>

<p>Dot’s finger had strayed to the corner of her
mouth, as she stared. For she had never met
Rosa before, and she was naturally rather a
bashful child.</p>

<p>“Now!” cried Ruth, again. “Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Who?” demanded Agnes, staring all about.
“Neale didn’t come, did he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s up in the baggage-car ahead,” said
Rosa, laughing.</p>

<p>“You sit right down here till I get him,” Ruth
commanded.</p>

<p>“Here’s the check,” Rosa said, and to the
amazement of the other Corner House girls Ruth
ran right away toward the head of the train with
the baggage check, and without saying another
word.</p>

<p>There were two baggage cars on the long train
and from the open door of the first one the man
was throwing trunks and bags onto the big wheel-truck.</p>

<p>So Ruth ran on to the other car. The side-door
was wheeled back just as she arrived, and
a glad bark welcomed her appearance.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah stood in the doorway, straining at
his leash held in the hands of the baggageman.
His tongue lolled out on his chest like a red necktie,
and he was laughing just as plainly as ever a
dog <i>did</i> laugh.</p>

<p>“I see he knows you, Miss,” said the man.
“You don’t have to prove property. He sure is
glad to see you,” and he accepted the check.</p>

<p>“No gladder than I am to see him,” said Ruth.
“Let him jump down, please.”</p>

<p>She caught the leather strap as the baggageman
tossed it toward her, and Tom Jonah
bounded about her in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>“Down, sir!” she commanded. “Now, Tom
Jonah, come and see the girls. But behave.”</p>

<p>He barked loudly, but trotted along beside her
most sedately. Tess and Dot had heard him,
and deserting Rosa and Agnes, they came flying
up the platform to meet Ruth and the big dog.</p>

<p>The two younger Corner House girls hugged
Tom Jonah, and he licked their hands in greeting.
Agnes was as extravagantly glad to see him as
were the others.</p>

<p>“How did you come to send for him, Ruthie?”
Agnes cried.</p>

<p>“I thought we might need a chaperon at the
tent,” laughed Ruth.</p>

<p>“The Gyps!” exclaimed Agnes, under her
breath. “Let them come now, if they want to.
You’re a smart girl, Ruthie.”</p>

<p>“Sh!” commanded the older sister. “Don’t
let the children hear.”</p>

<p>They helped Rosa into the wagonette and then
climbed in after her. Ruth had taken off Tom
Jonah’s leash and the good old dog trotted after
the carriage as it rolled through Main Street and
out upon the Shore Road toward the tent colonies.</p>

<p>Rosa brought all the news of home to the Corner
House girls and many messages from Mrs.
MacCall and Uncle Rufus. Of course, they could
expect no word from Aunt Sarah, for it was not
her way to be sympathetic or show any deep interest
in what her adopted nieces were doing.</p>

<p>The girls from the old Corner House might
have been a little homesick had there not been
so much to take up their attention each hour at
Pleasant Cove.</p>

<p>They brought Rosa to the little old woman who
lived in a shoe, and the moment Mrs. Bobster saw
how weak and white she was her sympathy went
out to her.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, tut!” she said, clucking almost as
loudly as Agamemnon himself. “We’ll soon fix
you up, my dear. If you stay long enough here
at the beach, you’ll be as brown and strong as
these other gals.”</p>

<p>Rosa put her arm about Ruth’s neck when the
Corner House girls were about to leave.</p>

<p>“This is a heavenly place, Ruth Kenway, and
you are an angel for bringing me down heah. I
don’t know what greater thing anybody could do
fo’ me—and you aren’t even kin!”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother, Rosa. I haven’t done
much——”</p>

<p>“There’s nothing in the world—but one thing—that
could make me happier.”</p>

<p>Ruth looked at her curiously, and Rosa added:</p>

<p>“To find June. I hope to find her some day—yes,
I do.”</p>

<p>“And suppose I should help you do <i>that</i>?”
laughed the oldest Corner House girl.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink15'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XV—TWO GIRLS IN A BOAT—TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG!</a></h2>

<p>“Oh, Dot! do come here. Did you ever see
such a funny thing in all your life?”</p>

<p>Tess Kenway was just as earnest as though
the discovery she had made was really of great
moment. The two bare-legged girls were on the
sands below the tent colony of Willowbend, and
the tide was out.</p>

<p>The receding waves had just left this wet flat
bare. Here and there the sand still dimpled to
the heave of the tide, and little rivers of water
ran into the hollows and out again.</p>

<p>“What is the matter, Tess?” asked Dot, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“See!”</p>

<p>Tess pointed down at her feet—where the drab,
wet sand showed lighter-colored under the pressure
of her weight.</p>

<p>“What is it?” gasped the amazed Dot.</p>

<p>There was a tiny round hole in the sand—just
like an ant hole, only there was no “hill” thrown
up about it. As Tess tip-tilted on her toes to
bring more pressure to bear near the orifice in
the sand, a little fountain of water spurted into
the air—shot as though from a fairy gun buried
in the sand.</p>

<p>“Goodness!” gasped Dot again. “What <i>is</i>
that?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say,” responded Tess. “Did
you ever see the like?”</p>

<p>“Oh! here’s another,” cried Dorothy, who
chanced to step near a similar vent. “See it
squirt, Tess! See it squirt!”</p>

<p>“What kind of a creature do you suppose can
be down there?” asked the bigger girl.</p>

<p>“It—it can’t be anything very big,” suggested
Dot. “At least, it must be awfully narrow to get
down through the little hole, and pull itself ’way
out of sight.”</p>

<p>This suggestion certainly opened a puzzling
vista of possibilities to the minds of both inland-bred
girls. What sort of an animal could possibly
crawl into such a small aperture—and yet
throw such a comparatively powerful stream of
water into the air?</p>

<p>They found several more of the little air-holes.
Whenever they stamped upon the sand beside one,
up would spring the fountain!</p>

<p>“Just like the books say a whale squirts water
through its nose,” declared Tess, who had rather
a rough-and-ready knowledge of some facts of
natural history.</p>

<p>A man with a basket on his arm and a four-pronged,
short-handled rake in his hand, was
working his way across the flats; sometimes
stooping and digging quickly with his rake, when
he would pick something up and toss it into his
basket.</p>

<p>He drew near to two Corner House girls, and
Dot whispered to Tess:</p>

<p>“Do you suppose he’d know what these holes
are for? You ask him, Tess.”</p>

<p>“And he’s digging out something, himself. Do
you suppose he’s collecting clams? Ruth says
clams grow here on the shore and folks dig them,”
Tess replied.</p>

<p>“Let’s ask about the holes,” determined Dot,
who was persistent whether the cause was good or
bad.</p>

<p>The two girls approached the clam-digger, hand
in hand. Dot hugged tight in the crook of one
arm her Alice-doll.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” Tess ventured, “will you tell us
what grows down under this sand and squirts
water up at us through such a teeny, weeny hole?”</p>

<p>The man was a very weather-beaten looking
person, with his shirt open at the neck displaying
a brawny chest. He smiled down upon the girls.</p>

<p>“How’s that, shipmet?” he asked, in a very
husky voice. “Show me them same holes.”</p>

<p>The sisters led the way, and the very saltish
man followed. It was not until then that Tess
and Dot noticed that one of his legs was of wood,
and he stumped along in a most awkward manner.</p>

<p>“Hel-<i>lo</i>!” growled the man, seeing the apertures
in the sand. “Them’s clams, an’ jest what
I’m arter. By your lief——”</p>

<p>He struck the rake down into the sand just beyond
one of the holes and dug quickly for half
a minute. Then he tossed out of the hole he had
dug a nice, fat clam.</p>

<p>“There he be, shipmets,” declared the clam-digger,
who probably had a habit of addressing
everybody as “shipmate.”</p>

<p>“Oh—but—did <i>he</i> squirt the water up at us,
sir?” gasped Dot.</p>

<p>The wooden-legged man grinned again and
seized the clam between a firm finger and thumb.
When he pinched it, the bivalve squirted through
its snout a fine spray.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy!” exclaimed Tess, drawing back.</p>

<p>“But—but <i>how</i> did he get down into the sand
and only leave such a tiny hole behind him?” demanded
Dot, bent upon getting information.</p>

<p>“Ah, shipmet! there ye have it. I ain’t a
l’arned man. I ain’t never been to school. I
went ter sea all my days till I got this here leg
shot off me and had to take to wearin’ a timber-toe.
I couldn’t tell ye, shipmets, how a clam does
go down his hole an’ yet pulls the hole down arter
him.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” sighed Dot, disappointedly.</p>

<p>“It’s one o’ them wonders of natur’ ye hear
tell on. I never could understand it myself—like
some ignerant landlubbers believin’ the world is
flat! I know it’s round, ’cos I been down one side
o’ it an’ come up the other!</p>

<p>“As for science, an’ them things, shipmets, I
don’t know nothin’ ’bout ’em. I digs clams; I
don’t pester none erbout how they grows——”</p>

<p>And he promptly dug another and then a third.
The girls watched him, fascinated at his skill.
Nor did the “peg-leg” seem to trouble him at
all in his work.</p>

<p>“Please, sir,” asked Tess, after some moments,
“how did you come to lose your leg—your really
truly one, I mean?”</p>

<p>“Pi-<i>rats</i>,” declared the man, with an unmoved
countenance. “Pi-<i>rats</i>, shipmet—on the Spanish
Main.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” breathed both girls together. Somehow
that expression was faintly reminiscent to
them. Agnes had a book about pirates, and she
had read out loud in the evenings at the sitting-room
table, at the old Corner House. Tess and
Dot were not aware that “the Spanish Main” had
been cleared of pirates, some years before this
husky-voiced old clam-digger was born.</p>

<p>The clam-digger offered no details about his
loss, and Tess and Dot felt some delicacy about
asking further questions. Besides, Tom Jonah
came along just then and evinced some distaste
for the company of the roughly dressed one-legged
man. Of course, he could not dig clams
in his best clothes, as Tess pointed out; but Tom
Jonah had confirmed doubts about all ill-dressed
people. So the girls accompanied the dog back
towards the tents.</p>

<p>The big girls had been out in the boat and Ruth
had left Agnes to bring up the oars and crab nets,
as well as to moor the boat, while she hastened
to get dinner.</p>

<p>The tide being on the turn they could not very
well pull the boat up to the mooring post; but
there was a long painter by which it could be tied
to the post. Agnes, however, carried the oars
up to the tent and then forgot about the rest of
her task as she dipped into a new book.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot came to the empty boat and at
once climbed in. Tom Jonah objected at first.
He ran about on the sand—even plunged into the
water a bit, and put both front paws on the gunwale.</p>

<p>If ever a dog said, “Please, <i>please</i>, little mistresses,
get out of the boat!” old Tom Jonah said
it!</p>

<p>But the younger Corner House girls paid no attention
to him. They went out to the stern, which
was in quite deep water, and began clawing overboard
with the crab nets. With a whine, the dog
leaped into the craft.</p>

<p>Now, whether the jar the dog gave it as he
jumped into the boat, or his weight when he joined
the girls in the stern, set the cedar boat afloat,
will never be known. However, it slid into the
water and floated free.</p>

<p>“We can catch some crabs, too, maybe, Tess,”
Dot said.</p>

<p>Neither of them noticed that the oars were gone,
but had they been in the boat, Tess or Dot could
not have used them—much. And surely Tom
Jonah could not row.</p>

<p>They did not even notice that they were afloat
until the tide, which was just at the turn, twisted
the boat’s nose about and they began drifting up
the river.</p>

<p>“Oh, my, Dot!” gasped Tess. “Where are we
going?”</p>

<p>“Oh-oo-ee!” squealed Dot, raking wildly with
one of the nets. “I almost caught one.”</p>

<p>“But we’re adrift, Dot!” cried Tess.</p>

<p>The younger girl was not so much impressed at
first. “Oh, I guess they’ll come for us,” she said.</p>

<p>“But Ruth and Aggie can’t reach us—’nless
they swim.”</p>

<p>“Won’t we float ashore again? We floated out
here,” said Dot.</p>

<p>She refused to be frightened, and Tess bethought
her that she had no right to let her little
sister be disturbed too much. She was old
enough herself, however, to see that there was
peril in this involuntary voyage. The tide was
coming in strongly and the boat was quickly passing
the bend. Before either Tess or Dot thought
to cry out for help, they were out of sight of the
camp and there was nobody to whom to call.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah had crouched down in the stern,
with his head on his paws. He felt that he had
done his duty. He had not allowed the two small
girls to go without him on this voyage. He was
with them; what harm could befall?</p>

<p>“I—I guess Alice would like to go ashore,
Tess,” hesitated Dot, at last, having seized her
doll and sat down upon one of the seats. The
boat was jumping a good deal as the little waves
slapped her, first on one side and then on the
other. Without anybody steering she made a
hard passage of it.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get ashore myself, child,” snapped
Tess. “But I don’t see how we are going to do
it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tess! are we going to be carried ’way out
to sea?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a goosey! We’re going <i>up</i> the river,
not <i>down</i>,” said the more observant Tess.</p>

<p>“Well, then!” sighed Dot, relieved. “It isn’t
so bad, is it? Of course, we’ll stop somewhere.”</p>

<p>“But it will soon be dinnertime,” said her sister.
“And I guess Ruth and Aggie won’t know
where we’ve gone to.”</p>

<p>In fact, nobody about the tent colony had noticed
the cedar boat floating away with the two
girls in it—to say nothing of the dog!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink16'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVI—THE GYPSIES AGAIN</a></h2>

<p>When Ruth shouted to Agnes from the kitchen,
where she was frying crabs, to call the children,
Agnes dropped the book she had been reading and
remembered for the first time that she had neglected
to tie the boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!” she shrieked. “See what I’ve
done!”</p>

<p>Ruth came to the opening in the front of the
tent, flushed and disheveled, demanding:</p>

<p>“Well, <i>what</i>? This old fat snaps so!”</p>

<p>“The boat!” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>Ruth stared up and down the shore. There
were other boats drawn up on the sand and a few
moored beyond low-water mark; but their boat
was not in sight.</p>

<p>“Have you let it get away, Agnes Kenway?”
Ruth demanded.</p>

<p>“Well! you don’t suppose I went down there
and pushed it off, do you?”</p>

<p>“This is no laughing matter——”</p>

<p>“I guess I—I’m not laughing,” gulped Agnes.
“It—it’s go-o-one! See! the tide is flowing in
and I forgot to tie it.”</p>

<p>She was a little mixed here; it was the boat she
had forgotten to tie.</p>

<p>“So,” murmured Ruth; “if the boat had been
tied, the tide wouldn’t have carried it away,” and
she had no intention of punning, either! “<i>Now</i>
what shall we do? That boat cost seventy-five
dollars, the man said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruthie!”</p>

<p>“What will Mr. Howbridge say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruthie!”</p>

<p>“No use crying about it,” said the oldest Corner
House girl, with decision. “<i>That</i> won’t help.”</p>

<p>“But—but it’s gone out to sea.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! The tide has taken it up the river.
It’s gone round the bend. I hope it won’t be
smashed on the rocks, that’s all. We must go
after it.”</p>

<p>“How?” asked the tearful Agnes.</p>

<p>“Get another boat, of course. But let’s eat.
The children will be hungry, and—— My goodness!
the crabs are burning up!” and she ran
back into the tent. “Get Tess and Dot, and tell
them to hurry!” she called from inside.</p>

<p>But Tess and Dot were not to be found. The
beach just then was practically deserted. It was
the dinner hour and the various campers all had
the sort of appetites that demands meals served
promptly on time.</p>

<p>Agnes ran to the other tents in Camp Willowbend;
but her small sisters were not with any of
the neighbors. It was strange. They had been
forbidden to go out of sight of their own tent
when neither Ruth nor Agnes was with them; and
Tess and Dot were remarkably obedient children.</p>

<p>“I certainly do not understand it,” Ruth said,
when Agnes brought back the news.</p>

<p>At that moment a shuffling step sounded outside
the tent and a husky voice demanded:</p>

<p>“Any clams terday, lady? Fresh clams—jest
dug. Ten cents a dozen; two-bits for fifty; half a
dollar a hundred. Fresh clams!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Agnes, springing to the tent entrance
so suddenly that the wooden-legged clam-man
started back in surprise. “Oh! have you
seen my sisters anywhere on the beach?”</p>

<p>“Hel-<i>lo</i>!” growled the startled man. “I dunno
’bout thet thar, shipmet. What kind o’ sisters
be they?”</p>

<p>“Two little girls,” said Ruth, eagerly, joining
Agnes at the opening. “One of them carried a
doll in her arms. She is dark. The bigger one
is fair.”</p>

<p>The saltish old fellow chuckled deep in his
hairy throat. “Guess I seen ’em, shipmets,” he
said. “Them’s the leetle gals that didn’t know
clam-holes.”</p>

<p>“Well! what became of them?” demanded the
impatient Agnes.</p>

<p>“Why——I dug ’em, shipmet, an’ they air in
this i-den-ti-cal basket now,” declared the clam-digger.</p>

<p>“Well!” gasped Agnes, behind her hand.
“Maybe the children didn’t know clam-holes; but
<i>he</i> doesn’t know beans!”</p>

<p>Ruth asked again: “We mean, what became
of the girls, sir?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell ye, shipmet. D’ye want any
clams?” pursued this man of one idea. “Ten
cents a dozen; two-bits for——”</p>

<p>“I’ll buy some clams—yes,” cried Ruth, in
some desperation. “But tell us where you last
saw our sisters, sir?”</p>

<p>“How many you want, shipmet?” demanded
the quite unmoved old fellow.</p>

<p>“Two!” cried Agnes. “There were only two
of them. Two little girls——Oh!”</p>

<p>Ruth had pinched her, and now said, calmly:
“Please count out a hundred for us, sir. Here is
fifty cents. And please tell us where you saw our
little sisters?”</p>

<p>“I seed two small gals, shipmet, down on the
flats yonder,” said the clam digger, setting down
his basket and squatting with the wooden leg
stretched out before him. He began to busily
count the clams onto the little platform before
the tent.</p>

<p>“Where did they go, sir?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“I didn’t take no pertic’lar notice of ’em, shipmet.
They had a dratted dog with them——”</p>

<p>“Oh! Tom Jonah is with them. Then they
<i>can’t</i> be lost,” gasped Agnes.</p>

<p>“Las’ time I ’member of cockin’ me eye at
’em,” declared the old clam digger, “they was
inter a boat right down here below this tent. The
dog was with ’em.”</p>

<p>He counted out the last clam, took his fifty
cents, and departed. The two older Corner
House girls looked at each other. Agnes was
very white.</p>

<p>“Do—do you suppose they drifted away in the
boat?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I expect so,” agreed Ruth. “Come on, Ag.
We’ll go up beyond the bend and see if we can
sight the boat.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if they fall overboard——”</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah would bring them both ashore if
they did, I believe,” said Ruth, though her voice
shook a little. “Do you want something to eat
before you go?”</p>

<p>Agnes looked at her scornfully. “I don’t ever
want to eat again if Dot and Tess aren’t found,”
she sobbed. “Come on!”</p>

<p>“We’ll take something along to eat, if you
don’t want to eat here,” Ruth said, sensibly.
“The children will be hungry enough when we
find them, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>“<i>If</i> we find them,” suggested the desperate
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like a goose, Ag!” exclaimed the
older sister. “Of course we’ll find them.
They’ve only drifted away.”</p>

<p>“But you said yourself the boat might be
smashed against the rocks.”</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah’s with them,” said Ruth,
confidently. “He could live in the water altogether,
you know. Don’t be worried about the children
being drowned—— Oh, Agnes!”</p>

<p>The change in her sister’s voice startled
Agnes, who had gone into the back part of the
tent. She ran out to where Ruth was wrapping
the fried soft-shell crabs in a sheet of brown paper.</p>

<p>Ruth was staring through the open flap of the
tent. Outside, about where the clam digger had
stood a few moments before, was the tall, scarred-faced
Gypsy tramp that they had seen at the
nomads’ camp the day they came to Pleasant
Cove!</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!” echoed Agnes, coming to Ruth’s
side.</p>

<p>But the older sister quickly recovered her self-possession.
Her first thought was:</p>

<p>“If Tom Jonah were only here!”</p>

<p>Ruth went to the door. The man leered at her
and doffed his old cap.</p>

<p>“Good day, little lady,” he said. “She remember
me—Big Jim—heh?”</p>

<p>“I remember you,” Ruth said, shortly.</p>

<p>“Ver’ proud,” declared the Gypsy, bowing
again.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” asked the oldest Corner
House girl, with much more apparent courage
than she really felt.</p>

<p>“You remember Zaliska—heh?” asked the man,
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“I remember her,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>“Little lady seen Zaliska since that day—heh?”</p>

<p>“What do you want to know for?” demanded
Ruth, puzzled, yet standing her ground. She remembered
in a flash all her suspicions regarding
the young girl who masqueraded as the Gypsy
Queen.</p>

<p>“Zaliska come here, heh?” said the man, doggedly,
and with something besides curiosity in his
narrow eyes.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why I should tell you if she had
been here,” declared Ruth, while Agnes clung to
her arm in fear.</p>

<p>“The little lady would fool Big Jim. No!
We want find Zaliska.”</p>

<p>“Don’t come here for her,” said Ruth, sharply.
“She’s not here.”</p>

<p>“But she been here—heh?” repeated the fellow.
“She come here like she was dressed at the
camp—heh? Then she go away different—heh?”</p>

<p>Ruth knew well enough what he meant. He
hinted that the masquerading girl had come here
to see Ruth, and discarded her queen’s garments
and slipped away in her own more youthful character.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I know what you mean,” she
said to the evil-faced man. “But one thing I can
tell you—and you can believe it. I have not seen
Zaliska since that day we girls came by your
camp.”</p>

<p>“Ha! she come here to see you——”</p>

<p>“No. She went to the hotel and to a friend’s
house in the village,” said Ruth, “asking for me.
I did not see her. She has not come here.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted the man, and backed away,
doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Now we are busy and you must not trouble us
any more,” declared Ruth, hurriedly. “Come,
Agnes!”</p>

<p>“He’ll come in the tent and search it,” whispered
Agnes, in her sister’s ear.</p>

<p>“I will speak to Mr. Stryver. He is here to-day,”
said Ruth, mentioning a neighbor in the
camp.</p>

<p>“Big Jim,” as the Gypsy called himself, had
backed away from the tent, but he watched the
departing girls with lowering gaze. At Mr.
Stryver’s tent Ruth halted long enough to tell
the gentleman to keep his eye on the Gypsy man
who was hanging about the camp.</p>

<p>“The women were here to sell baskets and such
like truck while you girls were off crabbing, this
morning,” said Mrs. Stryver. “It gives me the
shivers to have those folks around. I think we
ought to have these tent camps policed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ’tend to this fellow,” promised Mr.
Stryver, who was a burly man, and not afraid of
anything.</p>

<p>Ruth hurried Agnes away toward the bend without
another word.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell them Tess and Dot were
lost?” asked Agnes, gulping down a sob.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anybody to know it, if we can
help,” returned Ruth. “It just looks as though
we didn’t take sufficient care of them.”</p>

<p>“It—it was all my fault,” choked Agnes. “If
I had tied the boat as you told me——”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter whose fault it is,” said Ruth,
quickly. “Or, if it is anybody’s fault! We don’t
want folks to say that the Corner House girls
from Milton don’t know enough to take care of
each other while they are under canvas.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink17'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVII—ON WILD GOOSE ISLAND</a></h2>

<p>“My!” Tess gasped, sitting in the stern of the
drifting boat, “how fast the shores go past, Dot!
We’re going up the river awfully quick.”</p>

<p>“And so j-j-jerky!” exclaimed her sister, clinging
to the Alice-doll.</p>

<p>“You aren’t really afraid, are you, Dot?”</p>

<p>“No-o. Only for Alice. She’s always been
weakly, you know, since that awful time she got
buried alive,” said Dot, seriously. “And if she
should get wet and catch her death of cold——”</p>

<p>“But you mustn’t drop her overboard,” warned
Tess.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose I <i>would</i>, Tess Kenway?” demanded
Dot, quite hurt by the suggestion.</p>

<p>“If she did fall overboard, Tom Jonah would
save her, of course,” went on Tess.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t you say such things,” cried Dot.
“And <i>do</i>, please, stop the boat from jerking so!”</p>

<p>“I—I guess it wants to be steered,” Tess said.</p>

<p>The tiller ropes were at hand and Tess had observed
Ruth and Agnes use them. She began experimenting
with them and soon got the hang of
using the rudder. But as the boat was propelled,
only by the tide, it <i>would</i> “wabble.”</p>

<p>Tom Jonah watched all the small girls did with
his keen eyes. But he scarcely moved. The boat
floated on and on. Tess did not know how to
work the boat ashore—indeed, caught as the craft
was in the strong tide-rip, it would have taken
considerable exertion with the oars to have driven
it to land.</p>

<p>There chanced to be no other boats beyond the
bend on this day. On either hand there were
farms, but the houses were too far from the
shores for the dwellers therein to notice the plight
of the two small girls and the big dog in the bobbing
cedar boat.</p>

<p>The shores at the river’s edge were wooded for
the most part, as was the long and narrow island
in the middle of the river, not far ahead. This
latter was called Wild Goose Island, as Tess and
Dot knew.</p>

<p>“Maybe the boat will go ashore there,” said
Dot, more cheerfully.</p>

<p>“There are berries on that island,” cried Tess.
“Only they were not ripe when we were there
last week.” She was beginning to feel hungry;
it was past midday.</p>

<p>“But we can’t walk back to the tent from
there,” objected Dot.</p>

<p>“No-o,” admitted Tess. “It’ll be land, just
the same!”</p>

<p>But the tide swept the cedar boat out from the
lower end of the island and up the northern channel.
It was this fact that hid the drifting boat
from the anxious eyes of Ruth and Agnes when
they came around the bend, expecting to see the
missing craft. The island hid it.</p>

<p>Wild Goose Island was more than half a mile
long. In the channel where the boat floated, the
current of the river and the inflowing tide began
to battle.</p>

<p>There were eddies that seized the boat and
swept it in circles. The surface of the channel
was rippled by small waves. The boat bobbed
every-which-way, for Tess could not control the
rudder.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” gasped Dot. “I—I am afraid
my Alice-doll will be sick. Do—don’t you s’pose
we can get ashore, Tess?”</p>

<p>But Tess did not see how they could do that,
although the boat was now and then swept very
close to the shore of the island.</p>

<p>The island was a famous picnicking place; but
there were no pleasure seekers there to-day.
The shore seemed deserted as the girls were
swept on by the resistless tide.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dot stood right up and squealed—pointing
at the island. Tom Jonah lifted his head
and barked.</p>

<p>“There’s somebody, Tess!” declared Dot.</p>

<p>The bigger Corner House girl had seen the face
break through the fringe of bushes on the island
shore. It was a dark, beautiful face, and it was
a girl’s.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh! Let’s call her,” gasped Tess.
“She’ll help us.”</p>

<p>The two small Kenways had a strong belief in
the goodness of humanity at large. They expected
that anybody who saw their plight would
come to their rescue if possible.</p>

<p>For fully a minute, however, the girl in the
bushes of Wild Goose Island did not come out into
the open. Tess and Dot shouted again and again,
while Tom Jonah lifted up his head and bayed
most mournfully.</p>

<p>If the girl on the island did not want general
attention attracted to the place, it behooved her
to come out of concealment and try to pacify the
drifting trio in the cedar boat.</p>

<p>Her face was very red when she reappeared in
an open place on the shore. The distance between
her and the boat, which was now caught in
a small eddy, was only a few yards.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” she demanded,
in rather a sharp tone.</p>

<p>“We—we can’t stop the boat,” responded Tess.</p>

<p>“We want to get ashore,” added Dorothy,</p>

<p>“How did you get out there?” asked the strange
girl. She was older than Ruth, and although she
was very pretty, Tess and Dot were quite sure
they did not like her—much!</p>

<p>“We got in it, and it floated away with us,”
said Tess.</p>

<p>“Where from?” asked the girl on shore.</p>

<p>“Oh! ’way down the river. ’Round that turn.
We live at Willowbend Camp with Ruth and
Aggie.”</p>

<p>“Ruth <i>Who</i>?” the other demanded, sharply.</p>

<p>“Our sister, Ruth Kenway,” said Tess.</p>

<p>The girl on the island was silent for a moment,
while the boat turned lazily in the eddy. It now
was headed up stream again, when she said:</p>

<p>“Is that dog good for anything?”</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah?” cried Tess and Dot together.
“Why, he’s the best dog that ever <i>was</i>,” Dot
added.</p>

<p>“Does he know anything?” insisted the strange
girl.</p>

<p>“Uncle Rufus says he’s just as knowin’ as any
human,” Tess said, impressively.</p>

<p>“Does he mind?” pursued the girl on the shore.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Tess. “He’ll sit up and beg—and
shakes hands—and lies down and rolls over—and——”</p>

<p>“Say! those tricks won’t help you any,” cried
the other. “Can you make him swim ashore
here?”</p>

<p>“Why—ee—I don’t know,” stammered Tess.</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t want to let you have Tom
Jonah,” Dorothy hastened to explain.</p>

<p>“Goodness knows, <i>I</i> don’t want him,” said the
big girl, still tartly. “But if he can swim ashore
with the end of that rope you have coiled there in
the bow of your boat, tied to his collar, he may
be of some use.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Tess, scrambling toward the
bow at once.</p>

<p>“See that the other end is fast to your boat,”
commanded the girl on the island.</p>

<p>It was. Tess quickly knotted the free end of
the long painter to Tom Jonah’s collar.</p>

<p>“Now send him ashore, child!” cried the big
girl.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah was looking up at Tess with his
wonderfully intelligent eyes. He seemed to understand
just what was expected of him when the
rope was tied to his collar.</p>

<p>“Go on, Tom Jonah! Overboard!” cried Tess,
firmly.</p>

<p>“He—he’ll get all wet, Tess,” objected Dot,
plaintively.</p>

<p>“That won’t hurt him, Dot,” explained her
sister. “You know he loves the water.”</p>

<p>“Come on, here!” cried the girl on the island,
snapping her fingers. “Push him overboard.”</p>

<p>But Tom Jonah did not need such urging.
With his forepaws on the gunwale of the boat he
barked several times. The boat tipped a little
and Dot screamed, clutching the Alice-doll tighter
to her bosom.</p>

<p>“Go on, Tom Jonah!” shouted Tess. “You’re
rocking the boat!”</p>

<p>The big dog leaped over the gunwale into the
river, leaving the light craft tossing in a most
exciting fashion. Some water even slopped over
the side.</p>

<p>“Come on, sir! come on!” shouted the girl
ashore.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah swam directly for the beach where
she stood. The line uncoiled freely behind him,
slipping into the water. It was long enough to
reach the shore where the big girl stood; but none
too long.</p>

<p>The sag of the rope in the water began to
trouble Tom Jonah, strong as he was. Quickly
the girl drew off her shoes and stockings and
waded in to meet the laboring dog.</p>

<p>“Come on, sir! now we’ll get them!” she urged,
laying hold of the line.</p>

<p>The dog scrambled ashore, barking loudly.
The line was taut and the boat had swung around,
tugging on the other end like a thing of life.</p>

<p>“Now we have them!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>She pulled hard on the rope. Tom Jonah, seeing
what she was doing, caught the rope in his
strong jaws, and set back to pull, too. Tess and
Dot screamed with delight.</p>

<p>As the big girl slowly drew in the rope the dog
backed up the beach, and so the cedar boat, with
its two remaining passengers, came to land.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me! Oh, dear me!” gasped Dot,
standing in the bow of the boat. “I’m so glad
to get ashore. And so’s my Alice-doll,” she
added, seriously.</p>

<p>Tess helped her sister to jump down upon the
sand and then followed, herself. Tom Jonah
dropped the rope and bounded about them, barking
his satisfaction. But the strange girl was
looking up and down the river, and over at the
opposite shore, with a mind plainly disturbed.</p>

<p>“Come on, now!” she said, sharply. “Unfasten
the rope from that dog’s collar. We’ll
keep <i>that</i>. It may come in handy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you want it to pull the boat up on the
beach?” asked Tess, as she obeyed the command.</p>

<p>The strange girl was already unfastening the
rope from the ring in the bow of the boat. She
threw the line ashore and then pushed the boat
off with such vigor that she ran knee deep into the
river again.</p>

<p>“Oh! oh!” squealed Dot. “You’ll lose our
boat.”</p>

<p>“I want to lose it,” declared the girl, coming
back very red in the face from her exertions. “I
got you kids ashore, ’cause you might have been
tipped over, or hurt in some way. I’m not going
to be bothered by that boat.”</p>

<p>“But that’s Ruthie’s boat,” exclaimed Tess.</p>

<p>“I can’t help it! You young ones go into the
bushes there and sit down. Keep quiet, too.
Take the dog with you and keep <i>him</i> quiet.
Don’t let him run about, or bark. If he does I’ll
tie him to a tree and muzzle him.”</p>

<p>“Why—why, I don’t think that’s very nice of
you,” said Tess, who was too polite, and had too
deep a sense of gratitude, to say just what she
really thought of this conduct on the part of the
strange girl. “We might have saved the boat
for Ruth.”</p>

<p>“And it would give me dead away,” declared
the big girl, angrily. “You children be satisfied
that I took you ashore. Now keep still!”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t believe I like her very much, Tess,”
Dot whispered again.</p>

<p>The older Corner House girl was not only
puzzled by the strange girl’s actions and words,
but she was somewhat frightened. She and Dot
sat down among the bushes, where they were completely
hidden from the river and the opposite
shore, and called Tom Jonah to them.</p>

<p>He lay at their feet. He had shaken himself
comparatively dry, and now he put his head on
his paws and went to sleep.</p>

<p>“Well,” sighed Tess, caressing the dog’s head.
“I’m glad we have him with us.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink18'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XVIII—THE SEARCH</a></h2>

<p>Ruth and Agnes went around the wooded
point, called “Willowbend,” and looked up the
river. As we already know, the drifting boat,
with Tess and Dot and Tom Jonah in it, had gone
out of sight on the other side of Wild Goose
Island.</p>

<p>“It never came this way, Ruth!” groaned the
frightened Agnes. “They’ve drifted out to sea,
just as I said.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind,” Ruth declared, bound
to keep up her sister’s courage, and knowing well
that her conscience was punishing her cruelly.
“The tide is coming in. They were bound to
float up the river. But maybe the boat’s gone
ashore somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Or it’s sunk,” said the lugubrious Agnes.</p>

<p>“Now you stop that, Aggie Kenway!” cried
Ruth, stamping her foot. “I won’t have it.
With Tom Jonah those children would not easily
get into trouble.”</p>

<p>“They could fall out of the boat,” urged Agnes,
wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>“They’d not be foolish enough to rock the boat.
It’s all right, I tell you. I <i>did</i> expect to see
the boat from this spot; but it’s floated into
some cove somewhere. The children are safe
enough——”</p>

<p>“You don’t know!” blubbered Agnes.</p>

<p>“Keep still! Yes, I <i>do</i> know—I know as well
as I want to. But we’ll have to ask for help to
find them.”</p>

<p>“What kind of help?” asked Agnes.</p>

<p>“We’ll get Mr. Stryver’s motorboat,” said the
oldest Corner House girl, with decision.</p>

<p>As they went back around the bend they heard
a chorus of shouts from the camp. Agnes was
startled, being in a nervous state, anyway.</p>

<p>“What is that, Ruth? The Gypsies?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“If it is, then the Gypsies have adopted the
Milton high school yell. Don’t you recognize it?”
returned Ruth. “The boys have arrived.”</p>

<p>“Neale O’Neil!”</p>

<p>“I suppose Neale is with them.”</p>

<p>“He will help us,” cried the delighted Agnes,
sure in the ability of Neale O’Neil to do almost
anything.</p>

<p>“Well—I suppose he may,” admitted Ruth,
slowly.</p>

<p>Ruth had made no mistake in identifying the
school yell of their boy friends. There was a
crowd of boys at the two big tents reserved for
Joe Eldred and his friends. They had just come
on the auto-stage.</p>

<p>Already an American flag and the school pennant
were being raised on the flag-pole before the
tents. The scene at Willowbend Camp had been
a most quiet one ten minutes before; now it
seemed to be alive in every part, and the boys
from Milton were all over it.</p>

<p>They were like a herd of young colts let loose
in a new pasture. They got the flags up before
the girls came back, and then began running
races, and playing leap-frog on the sand. The
midday heat made no difference to them.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that water look inviting?” shouted
Ben Truman to Joe and some of the bigger boys.
“When do we go in swimming, Joe?”</p>

<p>“<i>You</i> can go when you like, Bennie,” returned
Eldred.</p>

<p>“I’d like right now,” declared the youngster.</p>

<p>“Clothes and all, I suppose, Ben?” drawled
Neale O’Neil.</p>

<p>“What’s clothes? I’m not afraid to go in just
as I am.”</p>

<p>“I dare you, Ben!” shouted another of the
boys, knowing the spirit of Truman.</p>

<p>“Done!” exclaimed Ben, and sprang away
toward the in-coming tide. He splashed half-knee
deep into the river before the others could
call him back. He probably had no intention of
going any deeper; but inadvertently he stepped
into one of the holes the wooden-legged man had
recently made when he dug for clams there, and
over Ben pitched upon his nose!</p>

<p>There was a great shout of laughter. Ben was
submerged—every bit! He came up blowing like
a porpoise.</p>

<p>“Come on in, fellows! the water’s fine!” he
gasped, not embarrassed by the accident.</p>

<p>“Thank you. We’ll wait till the bathing suits
arrive,” returned Neale. “Hello! Here are
the Corner House girls—two of them, at least.”</p>

<p>He hurried forward to greet Ruth and Agnes.
The other boys simmered down a little when they
observed the girls; most of them doffed their
caps politely, but only Joe and Neale knew Ruth
and Agnes very well.</p>

<p>“Oh, Neale!” was the latter’s greeting to her
boy friend. “Don’t tell the other fellows, but
Tess and Dot are lost.”</p>

<p>“Great goodness, Ag! You don’t mean it?”
cried Neale, keenly troubled by her statement.</p>

<p>“It’s not as bad as <i>that</i>,” Ruth interposed.
“They are out in our boat with Tom Jonah.”</p>

<p>“I knew you had him down here. He’ll take
care of them,” said Neale, with confidence.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” agreed Ruth. “But they all
got in the boat unbeknown to Aggie and me, and
the tide’s carried them up the river.”</p>

<p>“You don’t <i>know</i>!” burst out Agnes.</p>

<p>“Well, they couldn’t have drifted out into the
cove, that’s sure!” returned the older Corner
House girl. “I’m going to get Mr. Stryver’s
motorboat. Will you take us out in it and look
for the children, Neale? You can run a motorboat,
can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure! And I’ll do anything I can to help find
the children,” declared Neale O’Neil. “Now,
don’t you girls turn on the sprinklers——”</p>

<p>“Who’s crying?” gulped Agnes, angrily.</p>

<p>“You are—pretty nearly. And your eyes are
all red.”</p>

<p>“Hay fever,” sniffed Agnes, trying to joke.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get the boat right away. Come
on, Neale,” cried Ruth, and she started for the
Stryver tent. “I’m worried about those children,”
she added, over her shoulder. “There are
Gypsies about.”</p>

<p>She hurried on and Neale took Agnes by the
elbow and led her out of all possible earshot of
the other boys.</p>

<p>“Buck up, Aggie,” he said, gruffly, as a boy
will. “You’ve been a good little sport—always.
Don’t blubber about it.”</p>

<p>“But it was I who forgot to tie the boat,”
Agnes said.</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” urged Neale. So Agnes
gave him the particulars. “Funny how the boat
should have drifted out of sight so quickly,” was
the boy’s comment.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it? But it’s go-o-one——”</p>

<p>“There, there! We’ll find it and the children
will be all right,” he assured her.</p>

<p>Ruth came running with the key to the padlock
that moored the <i>Nimble Shanks</i> to the mooring
stake. They got out to her—just the two girls
and Neale—in a dory.</p>

<p>The <i>Nimble Shanks</i> was a blue boat with a high
prow and long, sweeping lines to the low stern.
It was not a large boat, but was built for speed.
The engine and steering-gear were amidships and
were arranged so that one man could handle the
craft.</p>

<p>Neale was naturally of a mechanical turn, as
well as an athlete. He had built a kerosene engine
during the winter, with some assistance from
Mr. Con Murphy, the shoemaker with whom he
lived in Milton. Moreover, he had driven a boat
just like this one of Mr. Stryver’s on the Milton
river.</p>

<p>While Ruth was unlocking the chain of the
<i>Nimble Shanks</i>, and fastening the dory in its
place, Neale whirled the fly-wheel and caught the
ignition spark; immediately the exhaust began to
pop and Neale shouted:</p>

<p>“All free, there, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Let her go, Neale!” returned Agnes, eagerly.
“I can’t wait, it seems to me.”</p>

<p>“Sit tight, then, ladies,” said Neale, as Ruth
scrambled aft. “I believe this craft can be made
to travel.”</p>

<p>The girls obeyed as the <i>Nimble Shanks</i> started.
She shot right out into the middle of the river,
and the wave thrown up by her wedge-like bow
rose higher and higher on either hand. Actually,
when the motorboat had been running for five
minutes, the girls in the sternsheets seemed sitting
at a much lower level than the surface of the
river.</p>

<p>“Goodness! if this boat stopped suddenly we’d
be drowned by that wave,” gasped Ruth.</p>

<p>Neale headed up the river in a grand curve.
They could see the shores on either hand. The
boys ashore cheered their departure, though they
did not know their errand.</p>

<p>They shot by the wooded bend like an express
train. The girls kept watch on either hand for
the boat. They hoped to see her rocking in some
cove along one shore or the other.</p>

<p>But it was Neale himself who first sighted the
drifting craft. The motorboat took the south
channel in passing Wild Goose Island. Neale
suddenly brought the speed of the craft down to
one-half.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat ahead,” he said to the girls.
“It appears to be empty. Stand up and see if it’s
the one.”</p>

<p>Ruth rose and clung to Agnes’ shoulder to
steady herself. She saw the empty cedar boat,
bobbing on the little waves beyond the far point
of Wild Goose Island.</p>

<p>“It’s her!” she said, breathlessly. “But
where are the children?”</p>

<p>“We’ll find out,” said Neale, quickly. “Sit
down again.”</p>

<p>“And Tom Jonah?” urged Ruth.</p>

<p>“Make up your mind that wherever the children
are, <i>he</i> is, too,” said Neale, and he let the
<i>Nimble Shanks</i> out again, and Ruth tumbled
promptly into her seat.</p>

<p>The motorboat fairly leaped ahead. In five
minutes they were near the empty boat, and Neale
shut off the engine entirely. Under the momentum
she had gained she slid right up beside the
tossing cedar boat.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh!” groaned Agnes. “Where <i>have</i> they
gone?”</p>

<p>“Not overboard, that’s sure,” said Neale,
cheerfully. “They would have overturned the
boat.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” began Ruth.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth!” shrieked Agnes. “Maybe they
were not in her after all.”</p>

<p>“But that clam man said he saw them.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t see them in the boat when it was
afloat,” said Agnes, clinging to the safer possibility.</p>

<p>“I know. But where else did they go?”</p>

<p>“Down the beach, maybe,” said Neale, slowly.</p>

<p>“The Gypsies have gotten them!” exclaimed
Agnes, in despair.</p>

<p>“Stop it, Ag!” cried Ruth, shaking her sister.
“You can think up the most perfectly awful
things——”</p>

<p>“Bet they got out of the boat on the shore
somewhere, and let it drift away again,” suggested
Neale, rather feebly.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t be like Tess to do such a foolish
thing,” said Ruth, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“They didn’t have anything to tie the boat up
with. There’s no painter in her,” said the observant
Neale.</p>

<p>“Of course there’s a painter!” cried Agnes,
jumping up. “A nice long one——”</p>

<p>“Where is it?” demanded the boy.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth! <i>That’s</i> gone!” gasped Agnes.</p>

<p>“Say!” said Neale, very seriously; “ropes
don’t come untied of themselves. Sure it was
fastened to the boat?”</p>

<p>“To that ring,” Ruth declared, confidently.</p>

<p>“And little Tess, or Dot, wouldn’t think to untie
it themselves—I’m sure,” the boy observed.
“They are with somebody who has taken them
out of the boat—be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“You only—only say so to comfort us,” sobbed
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ag! stop being a ‘leaky vessel’!” cried
Neale, with a boy’s exasperation at a girl’s tears.
“Crying won’t help you any.”</p>

<p>Ruth had been examining the cedar boat, carefully.
There was a little water in the bottom of
it. She knew it did not leak. And floating on
the water was a tiny russet leather slipper.</p>

<p>“That belongs to Dot’s Alice-doll!” she cried,
leaning over the gunwale and fishing for the slipper.
“They <i>were</i> in the boat.”</p>

<p>“We knew that before. The clam man said
so,” sniffed Agnes.</p>

<p>“But they got out in a hurry. Otherwise Dot
would have noticed that the doll had lost her
slipper.”</p>

<p>“That seems reasonable,” admitted Neale
O’Neil. “But what’s become of them? Where
did they go? Where are they now?”</p>

<p>He was staring all about the river, while the
two boats gently rubbed together, bobbing and
courtesying on the tide.</p>

<p>“Don’t see anybody on the shores—and not
another boat in sight,” the boy added.</p>

<p>“Maybe they went ashore on the island?” suggested
Agnes, looking back.</p>

<p>“There’s nobody there,” said her sister, looking
back, too. “Not a soul.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right. If there were anybody
besides the girls there they’d have some kind of a
boat, and we’d see it.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, Neale,” Ruth said. “And surely
any grown person who rescued the girls wouldn’t
have let the boat drift away again.”</p>

<p>The trio of searchers gazed at each other in
trouble and amazement. They could not explain
this mystery in any satisfactory way.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink19'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XIX—A STARTLING MEETING</a></h2>

<p>Tess and Dot, sitting in the middle of a brush
clump on Wild Goose Island, never saw the blue
motorboat with their sisters and Neale O’Neil in
it, fly past.</p>

<p>But the dark-faced girl, dressed in her bedraggled
Gypsy finery, saw the <i>Nimble Shanks</i>, for
she was on the watch at one side or the other of
the island, all the time.</p>

<p>She observed the motorboat overtake the drifting
craft, and saw Neale carry a line aboard the
latter and then start up the engine of the power
boat again. The two boats went up the lake at
a fair pace; but the searching party could not
travel so fast now, for fear of swamping the
towed boat.</p>

<p>“I don’t think this is much fun,” said Dot,
plaintively, when the big girl came back to them.
“It’s hot here—and I’m hungry—and my Alice-doll
has lost one of her shoes.”</p>

<p>“We’ll go up into the woods and pick some
berries,” said the strange girl, not unkindly. “I
know where there are some strawberries—and
they’re just as sweet.”</p>

<p>“Oh! that will be fine. I <i>do</i> love strawberries,”
declared Dot, easily appeased.</p>

<p>Tess was more troubled than her sister by this
strange situation. She felt, somehow, as though
the big girl were holding them prisoners. Yet
she could not understand <i>why</i>.</p>

<p>She got up from the ground and at once Tom
Jonah started up, barking and bounding about.</p>

<p>“Stop that dog!” exclaimed the big girl,
crossly. “Make him walk beside you. I’ll tie
him up,” she threatened.</p>

<p>“Then he’ll howl <i>awful</i>,” cried Dot. “We
tried that once at home. Don’t you ’member,
Tess?”</p>

<p>“Well, you keep him still,” snapped the big
girl.</p>

<p>At a word from Tess the old dog drooped his
tail and fell in behind them, in a most subdued
manner. They went up through the thick woods
to the higher part of the island. At no point
could the little procession have been seen from
the water.</p>

<p>There was a hillock up there, bare of trees,
the southern side of which was sown thickly with
strawberries. The bed was rich in berries, and
how sweet and delicate was their flavor!</p>

<p>“Oh, <i>so</i> much nicer than boughten berries!”
Tess declared, forgetting for the time all her
anxiety.</p>

<p>Indeed, both of the Corner House girls were
so busy satisfying their appetites with
strawberries that they forgot about the unpleasant side
to their adventure. Nor did they see the girl
who had helped them ashore from the boat, creep
over the knoll to watch the motorboat and its tow
going down the river again, by way of the northern
channel.</p>

<p>It was fully half past one. While Tess and
Dot feasted in the wild strawberry patch, their
sisters and Neale O’Neil munched cold, fried
crabs on the <i>Nimble Shanks</i>.</p>

<p>It took a lot of berries to satisfy the healthy
appetites of two girls like Tess and Dot whose
dinner had been indefinitely postponed. Dot
finally rolled right over in the shade, fast asleep,
her dress and fingers berry-stained and the last
plump one she had picked between her rosy lips!</p>

<p>The big girl came back and Tess whispered:
“We’d best not wake her, for she usually takes
a nap afternoons. When she wakes up, I guess
we’d best be going. Ruth and Agnes will be
<i>awfully</i> scared for us. And we’ve lost Ruth’s
boat, too,” she added, disconsolately.</p>

<p>“How do you expect to get off this island?”
demanded the strange girl.</p>

<p>“Why! how did you get <i>on</i>?” returned Tess.</p>

<p>“I paddled myself over on a raft of logs, early
this morning before anybody else was up,” said
the girl, after a minute. “I wasn’t going back
till night. But if I keep you children all day
there’ll be a big row, I s’pose,” she added, sullenly.</p>

<p>“I expect there will,” was Tess’ calm response.</p>

<p>“They’d get me for kidnapping, like enough,”
said the girl, as though talking to herself.
“Wish I hadn’t taken you out of that boat. But
you and the dog were raising an awful noise.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” said Tess, politely, “if we have
been a nuisance. But of course we’ve got to get
back to the tent before dark.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose so,” admitted the older girl.</p>

<p>“It’s funny Ruth hasn’t been up here before
now looking for us,” Tess observed.</p>

<p>The big girl turned her head so Tess should
not see her face. “Suppose she did not know you
went sailing in the boat?” she said.</p>

<p>“Why! perhaps that is the reason,” Tess
agreed. “They couldn’t have seen us; for if
they had, Ruth would have been after the boat
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the strange girl, “I’ll have to
get you across to the river bank. I wasn’t going
till night. But——”</p>

<p>“We are very much obliged to you,” Tess hastened
to say. “But we <i>couldn’t</i> stay that long.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well! I’ll leave you children at a farmer’s
over there. They’ll have a telephone and they’ll
get word to your sisters. You’ll get back by
suppertime.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” Tess said, simply.</p>

<p>But she was more than a little disturbed in her
mind. A raft of logs did not encourage her to
look forward to the trip to the mainland with
much pleasure.</p>

<p>Besides, the mystery regarding this pretty girl
made Tess feel <i>un</i>comfortable. Tess Kenway
was quite old enough to know the difference between
right and wrong; and there was something
about the strange girl that was decidedly wrong!</p>

<p>Why had she come out here to Wild Goose
Island in the early morning—before anybody in
the neighborhood was up? Was she a runaway?
Had she done something really <i>naughty</i>? and was
she afraid to have her folks find her?</p>

<p>It was all a great puzzle and Tess sighed and
shook her head. Finally she asked: “If you
please, where <i>is</i> the raft of logs?”</p>

<p>“Right down there,” said the girl, pointing to
the southern side of the island. “You can’t see
it. I dragged it into shallow water and covered
it up with branches and brush.”</p>

<p>“Is—is it safe?” queried Tess.</p>

<p>“Well, it didn’t drown me coming over,” said
the girl, with a short, hard laugh. “But the logs
came near parting.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>“I’ll fix ’em before we start back. That painter
off your boat will help. We will be all right,”
said the big girl, carelessly.</p>

<p>Dot awoke after a little, and so did Tom Jonah.
The whole party went down to the brush-fringed
shore. Tess saw that the girl had hidden her
raft very ingeniously. And it was evident, too,
that she hated to leave the island so long before
evening.</p>

<p>“Got myself in a nice mess!” the Corner
House girl heard her mutter, as she went about
binding the three logs together more tightly with
the strong rope from the cedar boat.</p>

<p>She worked hard for half an hour, standing
almost waist deep in the water as she made the
logs secure. It was not a heavy raft—nor was
it very safe looking, to Tess’ mind.</p>

<p>But fortunately Dot thought it would be great
fun to ride on such a craft, and Tess was too
brave to say anything that would really frighten
Dorothy.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah became restless and wanted to wander
about; but the big girl was very sharp with
him. “If he were my dog I’d make him mind
better!” she threatened. “If anything gives us
away, it will be that dog.”</p>

<p>Tess did not understand this; and like Dot she
felt hurt when anybody criticised Tom Jonah.
“Love me, love my dog” was the motto of the
younger Kenway sisters.</p>

<p>Finally the big girl pronounced the raft strong
enough, and she waded out of the water and put
on her skirts again. “Now, get aboard there,”
she commanded. “If we’ve got to go, we might
as well start. The tide will be less strong now.”</p>

<p>Dot skipped aboard the raft with her Alice-doll,
in great glee; Tess followed more slowly.
But when Tom Jonah tried to come, too, the big
girl, with the broken oar she used for a paddle,
drove him back.</p>

<p>“It won’t hold him up, too!” she cried. “Get
out!”</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t hurt Tom Jonah!” wailed Dot,
shrilly. “Don’t!”</p>

<p>“You look out!” warned Tess. “He’ll grab
you!”</p>

<p>Tom Jonah certainly <i>did</i> grab the paddle.
And he nearly wrenched it from the hands of the
big girl, strong as she was.</p>

<p>“He’ll tip us all over!” declared the girl, angrily,
flushed and breathing heavily. “Don’t you
see how deep in the water we are? Any little
wave will come right over the logs and wet us.”</p>

<p>“Well!” cried Tess. “We’re barefooted.
And we can’t leave Tom Jonah behind.”</p>

<p>“He can swim, can’t he? Silly!” exclaimed
the big girl. She pushed off the raft suddenly,
leaving the troubled dog on the bank. The current
caught the raft instantly and headed it down
stream. The big girl hurried to dip her paddle
in the water on the lower side and swerve the
head of the raft around.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom Jonah! Come! Come!” cried Dot,
fearful that the dog would be lost.</p>

<p>He plunged right in and swam to the rear of the
raft. He did not try to climb aboard, but he rested
his nose on the logs and paddled quietly behind.
The big girl paid him no further attention. She
had her hands full as it was, keeping the raft
from being swept down stream.</p>

<p>The current of the river had now conquered the
inflowing tide. The force of the latter was
spent; but the channel on this side of the island
was not rough. The little waves did not break
over their feet as yet.</p>

<p>The passage of the river was not, however, so
hard. The handsome dark girl was strong, and
she plied the broken oar with vigor. In half an
hour they drew near to the tree-fringed southern
bank.</p>

<p>The girls saw nobody along the shore, nor had
any boat put out to meet them. It was a day
when all the farmers seemed to be busy in their
fields, and this was a wild spot toward which the
raft had been aimed.</p>

<p>At last the end of the logs touched a shelving,
narrow beach. The big girl leaped off and commanded
Tess and Dot to follow immediately.
Already Tom Jonah had scrambled ashore and
was shaking himself, as a dog will.</p>

<p>Suddenly the big dog uttered a throaty growl.
None of the three girls paid any attention. The
strange girl was busy helping Tess and Dot to
land.</p>

<p>Again Tom Jonah uttered his warning, and
then barked sharply.</p>

<p>“Shut up!” commanded the big girl, turning
on him fiercely.</p>

<p>At that moment a man walked out of the wood.
He was a fierce little fellow with a black mustache
and a dirty red tie. His velveteen suit was
worn and greasy and his hat broken.</p>

<p>The strange girl turned suddenly and saw him.
She uttered a stifled scream and the fellow folded
his arms and said something to her sternly in
a language that afterwards Tess said “sounded
like powder-crackers exploding!”</p>

<p>The girl was terrified in the extreme. She
looked from side to side as though contemplating
escape. The fellow took another stride toward
her.</p>

<p>And then Tom Jonah intervened. The big
dog sprang with an awful growl, hurling himself
straight at the man’s chest. The fellow went
over backward and Tom Jonah held him down
with both paws on his chest and his bared teeth
at the victim’s brown throat!</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink20'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XX—THE FRANKFURTER MAN</a></h2>

<p>Dot screamed shrilly; but Tess said, with conviction:
“Well! I think it serves him right.
Let him holler. He had no business trying to
steal Ruthie’s chickens.”</p>

<p>For the young man that Tom Jonah held on the
ground, and threatened so dreadfully, was the
very Gypsy that had gotten into the hen-coop at
the old Corner House in Milton, weeks before.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you be afraid for him, Dot,”
added Tess, quite calmly. “Tom Jonah won’t
really <i>bite</i> him—not as long as he keeps still and
doesn’t try to get up——”</p>

<p>The fellow was moaning and begging just as
he had when the big dog “treed” him on the henhouse
roof.</p>

<p>“Tak’ away dog! Tak’ away dog!” he begged.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why we should—do you, Dot?”
pursued Tess, undisturbed. “He was going to
hurt <i>her</i>——”</p>

<p>Tess turned around. The strange girl who
had helped them out of the cedar boat and later
had brought them to the river bank from Wild
Goose Island, had disappeared like a shadow!</p>

<p>“Why—why,” stammered Tess. “And she
never said ‘Good-bye’!”</p>

<p>“I guess she was afraid of this man,” Dot
said, eyeing the prostrate and miserable victim of
Tom Jonah’s attack without much pity. “What
shall we do with him?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Tess, with a sudden sharp idea.
“She <i>was</i> afraid of him. Let us help her. She
helped us.”</p>

<p>“How will we?” inquired the smaller girl.</p>

<p>“Just let Tom Jonah hold him where he is.
We will give that pretty girl a good chance to
get away. Won’t we?”</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing,” agreed Dot.
“We can sit down and wait. I hope it isn’t too
long a walk to the camp, Tess. Somehow those
strawberries didn’t stay by me—much. I’m
hungry right now!”</p>

<p>“We’ll keep him here a few minutes. Then
we’ll find the road and start right back home. I
know the direction,” said Tess, with confidence.</p>

<p>The frightened Gypsy moaned and begged for
them to call off the dog; and Tom Jonah growled
most frightfully every time the man squirmed.
Under other circumstances the girls would have
been quite stricken with pity for the poor man;
but he had tried to steal Ruth’s hens, and he had
now frightened their new friend away, and, as
Dot whispered, “it served him right.”</p>

<p>Of course, they knew that the big dog would
not really harm the fellow.</p>

<p>After some fifteen minutes Tess got up and
motioned Dot to do the same. “We’d better
start. The afternoon is going,” she said to her
younger sister. “And I guess it’s a long walk
home. Come on, Tom Jonah.”</p>

<p>The old dog lifted his head enquiringly. The
muscles of his shoulders and fore-paws relaxed.</p>

<p>“Come on!” commanded Tess. “Leave him
alone. Let him up, Tom Jonah! I guess he has
been punished enough. Don’t you think so,
Dot?”</p>

<p>The smaller girl nodded seriously, staring at
the trembling Gypsy. “I hope you won’t ever
try to steal our Ruthie’s hens again,” she said,
pointedly.</p>

<p>The moment the fellow knew he was free, he
scrambled up and dodged into the bushes. He
did not stay for a word.</p>

<p>“That big girl must have gotten away by this
time,” Tess said, cheerfully. “And he is too
scared to catch her, anyway.”</p>

<p>Which was probably true. The two small girls
walked away from the river bank in the direction
where they knew the auto-stage road lay. Tom
Jonah paced beside them, looking about suspiciously,
and licking his lips now and then with
his red tongue.</p>

<p>It was remarkable how ferocious he had been
with that Gypsy, and how perfectly kind he was to
the small Kenways. And nothing much could
have overtaken them just then that Tom Jonah
would not have attacked.</p>

<p>They came out of the fringe of wood that bordered
the river and crossed a farmer’s fields.
But the house was at a distance, and in the other
direction from Pleasant Cove and the camps; so
the girls did not go to that house.</p>

<p>In fact, Tess felt quite brave now that she was
again on the mainland. She was sure that they
could easily find Willowbend Camp.</p>

<p>They came out into the hot, dusty road. It
stretched before them as bare as a tennis-court
and as hot as a sea-beach. The trees that bordered
it were white with dust far up their trunks
and the leaves of their lower branches, too, were
dust-covered.</p>

<p>This was the result of rapidly passing automobiles
on the road; but none of these vehicles
was in sight now. The road seemed deserted.</p>

<p>Save for just one thing. Dot saw it before
Tess.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” the smaller girl cried. “Isn’t
that a peanut man, Tess? Don’t you wish you
had a nickel?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t a peanut man,” said Tess, after a
sharp look at the man pushing the little wagon
along the road before them.</p>

<p>“Isn’t he?” returned Dot, disappointedly.</p>

<p>“It’s a hot-frankfurter man,” declared Tess.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tess! a nickel would buy two frankfurter
sandwiches,” gasped Dot. “And I’m <i>so</i> hungry.”</p>

<p>So was Tess. The thought of the steaming
sausages lying on the split Vienna roll, with a
spoonful of mustard on each half-sausage, was
enough to make <i>any</i> hungry person’s mouth
water. At least, any hungry person of the age
of Tess and Dot Kenway.</p>

<p>Where the frankfurter man had been with his
wagon away up this country road, the girls did
not know; but before they overtook him they
smelled the warm sausages and saw that the top
of his boxlike wagon was covered over with a
glass case and that everything was clean about
his outfit.</p>

<p>So eager and hungry were they that Tess and
Dot fairly trotted through the hot dust to overtake
the man. He was a short, sturdy man in
a blue shirt, khaki trousers, and a broad-brimmed
straw hat. When Tom Jonah bounded along beside
him, sniffing in a friendly fashion, he turned
around and saw the girls.</p>

<p>“How-de-do!” he said, smiling. “You want
a hot frankfurter, little girls?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Dot, frankly.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t, sir—not till we get to Willowbend
Camp,” Tess hastened to say, squeezing
Dot’s hand admonishingly.</p>

<p>Dot’s lower lip trembled and the man asked:</p>

<p>“Why can’t you have ’em now?”</p>

<p>“We—we should have to ask Ruthie,” said
Tess, slowly.</p>

<p>“Who’s she?”</p>

<p>“Our sister. We—we don’t carry any money
in these old clothes. She’s afraid we’ll lose it
out of our pockets,” said Tess, honestly.</p>

<p>“Oh-ho!” exclaimed the man.</p>

<p>“But we’re awful hungry,” ventured Dot.
“And so’s my Alice-doll. We been shipwrecked,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Shipwrecked?” asked the man, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Not just <i>that</i>, Dot,” said Tess, doubtfully.
“We were sort of castaways.”</p>

<p>“Well, we lost our boat, didn’t we?” demanded
Dot. “And isn’t that being shipwrecked?”
She was just hungry and tired
enough to be rather “touchy.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it,” said the frankfurter man,
as the girls and Tom Jonah trotted along beside
his little wagon.</p>

<p>So Tess—with much assistance from Dot—related
their exciting adventures since the wooden-legged
clam-digger had shown them what it was
that squirted water up through the tiny holes
on the clam-flat.</p>

<p>Sometimes the frankfurter man laughed, or
chuckled; at other times he looked quite grave.
And finally he insisted upon stopping under a
broad, shady tree beside the road, and resting
while he listened to the remainder of the story.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he opened the glass case and took
out a couple of paper napkins and two rolls which
were as white as snow when he split them with
a very sharp knife. He buttered both sides of
these rolls lavishly.</p>

<p>Then he opened the steaming frankfurter pot
and oh! how the luscious steam gushed out! Dot
grabbed Tess’ hand hard. She thought she was
going to faint, for a moment—it smelled so good!</p>

<p>He selected two fat frankfurters and split them
evenly. He placed them on the buttered rolls.
He put on mustard with a lavish hand. And then
he closed the rolls and wrapped the napkins about
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw Tom Jonah standing, too,
watching him with wistful intentness, his pink
tongue hanging out of his mouth. If ever a dog’s
countenance expressed hunger, it was shown now
in Tom Jonah’s face. But he was too much of
a gentleman, just as his collar said, to bark.</p>

<p>So the frankfurter man, without saying a word,
opened the pot again and took out a third sausage.
This he did not split or put mustard on.</p>

<p>“Would you little girls like to eat a lunch now
and pay me for it the next time you see me?”
he asked, smiling at Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dot, clasping her hands and almost
letting the Alice-doll fall.</p>

<p>“You—you are <i>so</i> kind!” said Tess, her voice
fairly trembling.</p>

<p>He passed the two wrapped sandwiches over
with a polite bow. “You are very welcome,” he
said. “And I am going to give your dog one for
himself because he grabbed that Gypsy. He’s a
brave dog and deserves one.”</p>

<p>“Oh! if you would be so good!” cried Tess.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah made one mouthful of the frankfurter.
You see, <i>he</i> had not cared at all for the
strawberries!</p>

<p>“Now,” said the frankfurter man, as the girls
walked on beside him again, munching their sandwiches,
“that road yonder to the left leads right
down to the beach and to those tents. You can
see the flags flying above them now—see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir!” returned Tess and Dot, in delight.</p>

<p>“Then you can easy find your way. Good-day,
young ladies. I know your sisters will be anxious
to see you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” Tess said, not forgetting
her manners. “And we shall not forget that we
owe you for the sausages.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Always pay your debts,” said
the man, laughing, and trundled his cart on
through the dust, while the Kenway sisters
trudged down the shadier road toward the beach.</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes they were seen coming. The
entire encampment had turned out to search for
the lost children. The boys from Milton had
gone in all directions to look for Tess and Dot.</p>

<p>It was only to Ruth and Agnes that the small
girls related the details of their surprising adventure.
And Agnes did not understand entirely,
and was much troubled over the identity
of the girl who had befriended her sisters in so
strange a fashion.</p>

<p>Ruth had no difficulty in guessing who she was.
It was the girl with the Gypsies who had masqueraded
as the queen. The oldest Corner
House girl was sure that it was she. And Ruth
understood that she must be striving to get away
from the Gypsies.</p>

<p>“I hope she won’t go so far from here that I
shall never see her again,” thought Ruth. “For
she was interested in Rosa Wildwood, I am sure;
and it might be that she could tell me something
about Rosa’s missing sister.”</p>

<p>While Agnes put forth many “guesses” and
“supposin’s” about the strange girl, Dot had
quite another problem in her enquiring mind.
And finally, as they were getting ready for bed
that night, she threw out a leading question which
attracted the immediate attention of her three
sisters:</p>

<p>“Say, Ruthie,” she asked, “how do frankfurters
grow?”</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Agnes, and clapped a hand
over her own mouth to keep from laughing.</p>

<p>“How do they <i>grow</i>, dear?” returned Ruth,
rather taken aback herself.</p>

<p>“Goodness gracious, child!” exclaimed Tess.
“They don’t grow on bushes like pea-pods.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not!” ejaculated Dot, who
did not like to be considered ignorant. “A frankfurter
flies, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” murmured Ruth. “Hear her!”</p>

<p>“Oh! I mean it crawls—it <i>creeps</i>. Of
course,” Dot hurried to add.</p>

<p>Agnes exploded here. She could not keep in
any longer.</p>

<p>“Well, I think you’re real mean!” complained
Dot. “You won’t tell me. I guess it’s a fish,
then. Does it <i>swim</i>?”</p>

<p>“Goodness!” cried Tess.</p>

<p>“Then they come in bunches like bananas!”
declared the frantic Dot.</p>

<p><i>This</i> was the worst yet. Agnes rolled on the
matting of the bedroom and almost choked.
Ruth herself was laughing heartily at her small
sister as she gathered her into her arms and told
her just how the sausage-meat was stuffed into
the frankfurters’ skins.</p>

<p>“Well!” murmured Dot, at last, and rather
sleepily. “I don’t care. I believe they are the
very <i>nicest</i> things there are to eat—so there!
Those the frankfurter man gave us were perfectly
lovely.”</p>

<p>That was what suggested the Frankfurter
Party, and the Frankfurter Party was one of the
very happiest thoughts that Ruth Kenway ever
evolved. We shall have to hear about it, in
another chapter.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink21'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXI—MRS. BOBSTER’S MYSTERIOUS FRIEND</a></h2>

<p>Rosa Wildwood quickly showed improvement
after her arrival at Pleasant Cove. Under the
ministrations of the little old woman who lived
in a shoe the Southern girl could not help feeling
a measure of contentment, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Her hostess was such a cheerful body! And,
as Agnes had promised, Rosa was supplied with
good, hearty food—and plenty of it.</p>

<p>There was a glass of warm milk, fresh from the
cow, on the stand beside the head of her little
chintz-hung bed every morning when Rosa awoke.
For Mrs. Bobster was up and about by daybreak.</p>

<p>When Rosa came down to the sunlit kitchen,
breakfast was ready and the little old woman who
lived in a shoe declared she had all her “outside”
chores done, saving her regular work in her garden.</p>

<p>Rosa sometimes helped about the housework.
The doctor had told her that certain forms of
housework would be good for her. But she had
to be very exact and careful in doing the work
about the shoe-house, for Mrs. Bobster was a
New England housekeeper of the old school and
was as methodical as Grandfather’s Clock.</p>

<p>The girls from Milton did not neglect Rosa
Wildwood. At least, the Corner House girls and
their friends did not. Pearl Harrod and the girls
at Spoondrift Bungalow came with a wagonette
and took her driving. The repairs had been
made upon the bungalow and Pearl’s party was
there again—all but the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>Ruth had decided to stick to the tent for the
remainder of their stay at Pleasant Cove. And
Willowbend Camp was becoming the liveliest spot
along the entire beach-front.</p>

<p>Ruth and her sisters came after Rosa and took
her out in their boat. The boys who were living
at Willowbend, too, took an interest in the frail
Southern girl. For Rosa Wildwood, with the
color stealing back into her cheeks and lips, and
her eyes bright again, was a very attractive girl
indeed!</p>

<p>Dot Kenway’s birthday came at this time, and
that was the date set for the Frankfurter Party.
Dot’s guesses about the origin and nature of the
hearty and inviting, if not delicate, frankfurter,
had delighted the campers who heard the story;
and Dot’s sisters and Neale spent some time and
a good deal of ingenuity in preparing for the
festive occasion.</p>

<p>Rosa came over to the tent colony and helped
the girls prepare for the party. Moreover, she
had a secret to impart to Ruth.</p>

<p>“Don’t let the other girls hear, Ruth Kenway,”
she said, with much mystery. “But Mrs. Bobster
is the oddest thing!”</p>

<p>“Well! I guess she is,” laughed Ruth. “But
she’s <i>good</i>.”</p>

<p>“Good as gold,” agreed Rosa. “But she has
some funny ways. Of course I go to bed early.
The doctor told me I should.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You’d think she’d go to bed early, too, when
she’s up so soon in the morning?”</p>

<p>“Well——I suppose that’s a matter of taste,”
Ruth observed.</p>

<p>“Anyway, you know how lonesome it is over
there?”</p>

<p>“I guess there are not many people about—after
dark.”</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” cried Rosa. “Mrs. Bobster
scurries around and does all her out of doors
chores before dark. And she locks and bolts all
the doors. She is really afraid after dark.”</p>

<p>Ruth nodded. She remembered how once the
little old woman who lived in a shoe had spoken
to her about being afraid.</p>

<p>“Well, she locks and bolts the doors,” said
Rosa, “and then we have supper and I go to bed.
Sometimes, like a good child, I go right to sleep.
Sometimes, like a bad child, I <i>don’t</i>.”</p>

<p>“Well—what then?”</p>

<p>“Then I hear Mrs. Bobster talking. She has
company. I never hear the company come in,
or go out; but she has it every night.”</p>

<p>“And never says anything about it?”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” said Rosa. “I hinted once or
twice that she must have company every night,
and all she said was that she didn’t like sitting
alone.”</p>

<p>“Is it a man or a woman?” asked Ruth.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” laughed Rosa. “That’s one
of the funny things about it. Although I hear
Mrs. Bobster sometimes chattering like a magpie,
I never hear an answer.”</p>

<p>“What?” gasped Ruth, in amazement.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Rosa, nodding confidently.
“Whoever it is talks so low that I haven’t heard
his, or her, voice yet!”</p>

<p>“A dumb person?” suggested Ruth.</p>

<p>“Maybe. At any rate, I couldn’t tell you for
the life of me whether it is a man or a woman that
comes to see the little old woman who lives in a
shoe. Isn’t it odd, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” admitted Ruth.</p>

<p>“But she treats me well,” sighed Rosa. “I
wouldn’t do her any harm for the world. But I
<i>am</i> awfully curious!”</p>

<p>It was this day, too—the day of Dot’s party—that
the wooden-legged clam-digger came along
through the Willowbend tent colony again. He
always came to the tent of the Corner House girls
when he appeared; Ruth was a regular customer,
for she and her sisters were fond of shellfish.</p>

<p>“I’ll have fifty to-day, Mr. Kuk,” she said to
the saltish individual when he hailed her from
outside the tent. Ruth had learned that his name
was Habakuk Somes; everybody along the beach
called him “Kuk,” and Ruth, to be polite, tagged
him with “Mister” in addition.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah appeared and showed his disapproval
of the clam man by a throaty growl.
“That thar dawg don’t like me none too well,”
said the clam man. “What d’yeou call him?”</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah.”</p>

<p>“Thet’s enough to sink him,” said the man with
a grin. “How’d ye come ter call him that?”</p>

<p>“It’s his name,” said Ruth. “It was engraved
on his collar when he came to our house in Milton.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then he ain’t allus been your dawg, shipmet?”
demanded the man.</p>

<p>“No. He came to us. We don’t know where
from. But he is a gentleman, and he is going to
stay with us as long as he will.”</p>

<p>The clam man blinked, and said nothing more.
But he cast more than one glance at Tom Jonah
before he went away.</p>

<p>The preparations made for the birthday party
included the purchase of a good many pounds of
first quality frankfurters. And when they were
delivered to the Corner House girls’ tent, the fun
began.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were sent away for the morning
to play with some of the children at Enterprise
Camp. Then Ruth and Agnes and Rosa and
Neale set to work to make frankfurters into the
very funniest looking things that you could imagine!</p>

<p>With bits of tinsel and colored paper and pins
and other small wares, the young folks set to work.
They made frankfurters look like caricatures of
all kinds of beasts and birds, and insects as well.
One was the body of a huge, gaily-winged butterfly.
Another was striped and horned like a worm
of ferocious aspect.</p>

<p>They were made into fishes, with tails and fins.
Neale made a nest with several “young” frankfurters
poking their heads out for food, while the
mother frankfurter was just poised upon the
edge of the nest, her wings spread to balance her.</p>

<p>There were short-legged frankfurters, with
long, flapping ears, like dachshunds, and long,
stiff-legged frankfurters, with abbreviated tails,
and appearing to gambol like lambs. There were
several linked together and apparently creeping
about like a species of jointed, horrid caterpillar.</p>

<p>Then they actually <i>were</i> bunched like bananas!
while some grew, husked, like sweetcorn, and
some had the green, fluffy tops of carrots cunningly
fastened to them and were tied together
as carrots are bunched in the market.</p>

<p>Neale’s ingenuity, however, rose to its height
when he stretched a slanting wire across the tent,
higher than the partition, and made several
“aeroplanes” with bodies of the succulent sausage,
which he could start at one end of the wire
to “fly” to the other end.</p>

<p>The young folks came to Willowbend Camp
about five o’clock to enjoy the festivities. The
older Corner House girls, with the help of some
of their friends, served the crowd a hearty supper,
the main course of which was hot frankfurters,
prepared by the “frankfurter man”
whose acquaintance Tess and Dot had made.</p>

<p>When the fun was over the guests took the
fancy-dressed sausages home as souvenirs.</p>

<p>Neale and Agnes and Ruth went home with
Rosa, for it was a long walk, and part of the way
it was lonely. One of the ladies who had chaperoned
the party remained with Tess and Dot
while their sisters were absent.</p>

<p>The young folk had a pleasant walk, for there
was a moon. Coming finally in sight of the home
of the little old woman who lived in a shoe, Ruth
said to Rosa, who walked with her:</p>

<p>“It is a lonely spot, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“But I never feel afraid. Only I’m curious
about Mrs. Bobster’s friend——There! See it?”
she cried, suddenly, but under her breath.</p>

<p>“See what?” Ruth asked.</p>

<p>“The shadow on the curtain,” said Rosa.</p>

<p>At the same moment Agnes said: “Hello!
Mrs. Bobster has company.”</p>

<p>There was a lamp lit in the tiny front room of
the cottage. Plainly silhouetted upon the white
shade was a man sitting in a chair.</p>

<p>“What! With his hat on?” exclaimed Ruth.
“Who can it be?”</p>

<p>“He isn’t very polite, whoever he is,” said
Neale.</p>

<p>“Let’s see about it,” suggested Agnes. “Do
you know anything about him, Rosa?”</p>

<p>“I only know she has had a visitor sometimes—after
I’m in bed,” said the Southern girl.</p>

<p>“Come on! let’s go in the side door,” said
Agnes, in a low voice.</p>

<p>But when they had tiptoed to the door they
found it locked. Rosa laughed. “I tell you she
never leaves a door or window unfastened after
dark,” she said.</p>

<p>They heard the little old woman who lived in
a shoe coming to the door to let them in. But
Rosa had to assure her who it was before Mrs.
Bobster unlocked the door.</p>

<p>“But you had company?” said Agnes, rather
pertly.</p>

<p>“Eh?” returned Mrs. Bobster, setting the
broom behind the hall door. “Oh, yes! I don’t
never kalkerlate ter be alone many evenings.”</p>

<p>“Is he here now?” demanded Neale, laughing.</p>

<p>“Who? <i>Him?</i> No,” said the widow, calmly.
“He’s bashful. He went out jest as you young
folks come in. Sit right down, children, an’ I’ll
find a pitcher of milk an’ some cookies.”</p>

<p>The Corner House girls and Rosa—to say nothing
of Neale O’Neil—were amazed. They looked
at each other wonderingly as the widow bustled
out to the pantry.</p>

<p>“I’d give a penny,” murmured Rosa Wildwood,
“to know who her mysterious friend is.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink22'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXII—THE YARN OF THE “SPANKING SAL”</a></h2>

<p>The wooden-legged clam digger, Habakuk
Somes, seemed suddenly to have acquired a great
interest in Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>He appeared almost every day at the tent of
the Corner House girls and did his best to become
friendly with the dog. Tom Jonah grew
used to his presence, but he would allow no familiarities
from the dilapidated waterside character.</p>

<p>The girls thought “Kuk” Somes only queer;
the boys “joshed” him a good deal. Nobody
minded having him around, considering merely
that he was a peculiar fellow, and harmless.</p>

<p>His tales of sea-going and sea-roving were wonderful
indeed. How much of them was truth and
how much pure invention, the older Corner House
girls and Neale O’Neil did not know. However,
they forgave his “historical inaccuracies” because
of the entertainment they derived from his
yarns.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot listened to the old fellow with
perfect confidence in his achievements. Had he
not known—in a moment—what it was that shot
water up through the holes in the clam flat? The
smaller girls listened to old Kuk Somes with unshaken
confidence.</p>

<p>“And how did the pirates get your leg, Mr.
Kuk?” asked Tess. “Your really truly leg, I
mean.”</p>

<p>She and Dot were sitting on the edge of the
tent-platform, under the awning, with their bare
feet in the sand, with Tom Jonah lying comfortably
between them. The dog had a brooding eye
upon the clam digger, who sat on a broken lobster
trap a few feet away.</p>

<p>“Huh! them pi-<i>rats</i>?” queried the clam digger.
“Well—er—now, did I say it was pi-<i>rats</i>
as got my leg, shipmet?”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did, sir.” Dot hastened to bolster
up her sister’s statement of fact. “And you said
it was on the Spanish Main.”</p>

<p>“Well!” declared the old man, “so it was, an’
so they did. Pi-<i>rats</i> it was, shipmet. An’ I’ll
tell yer the how of it.</p>

<p>“I was carpenter’s mate on the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i>,
what sailed from Bosting to Rio, touchin’ at some
West Injy ports on the way—pertic’larly Porto
Rico, which is a big merlasses port. We had a
good part of our upper holt stowed with warmin’
pans for the merlasses planters——”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Kuk!” ejaculated Tess in rather a
pained voice. “Isn’t that a mistake? <i>Warming
pans?</i>”</p>

<p>“Not by a joblot it ain’t no mistake!” returned
the old man. “Warming pans I sez, an’
warming pans I sticks to.”</p>

<p>“But my geogoraphy,” Tess ventured, timidly,
and mispronouncing the word as usual, “says
that the West Indies are tropical. Porto Rico
is near the Equator.”</p>

<p>“Now, ain’t that wonderful—jest wonderful?”
declared the clam digger, smiting his knee with
his palm. “Shows what it is to be book l’arned,
shipmet.</p>

<p>“’Course, <i>I</i> knowed them was tropical places,
but I didn’t know ’twas all writ down in books—joggerfries,
do they call ’em?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Tess, seriously. “And it is
so hot down there they couldn’t possibly need
warming pans.”</p>

<p>“Now, ye’d think that, wouldn’t ye, shipmet?
And I’d think it. But the skipper of the <i>Spankin’
Sal</i>, he knowed dif’rent.</p>

<p>“A master brainy man was Captain Roebuck.
That was his name—Roebuck,” declared the clam
digger, solemnly. “Hev you ever seen a warming
pan, shipmet—an old-fashioned warmin’
pan?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” cried Tess and Dot together.
“There’s one hangs over the mantelpiece in the
sitting-room of the old Corner House,” added
Tess. “That’s where we live when we’re at
home in Milton.</p>

<p>“And it is a round brass pan, with a cover
that has holes in it, and a long handle. Mrs. MacCall
says folks used to put live coals in it and
iron the beds before folks went to bed, in the cold
weather. But we got furnace heat now, and
don’t need the warming pan.”</p>

<p>“Surely, surely, shipmet,” agreed the clam
digger. “Them’s the things. And Cap’n Roebuck
of the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i>, plagued near crammed
the upper holt with them.</p>

<p>“It looks right foolish, shipmet; but that skipper
got a chancet ter buy up a whole lot o’ them
brass warmin’ pans cheap. If he’d seen ’em
cheap enough, he’d bought up a hull cargo of
secon’ hand hymn books, and he’d took ’em out
to the heathen in the South Seas and made a profit
on ’em—he would that!” pursued Kuk, confidently.</p>

<p>“He must have been a wonderful man, sir,”
said Tess, while Dot sat round-eyed and listened.</p>

<p>“Wonderful! wonderful!” agreed the clam
digger. “But about them warmin’ pans. When
we got ter Porto Rico we broke out the first of
them things. Looked right foolish. All them
dons in Panama hats and white pants, an’ barefooted
comin’ aboard to look over samples of
tradin’ stock, an’ all they can see is warmin’ pans.</p>

<p>“‘What’s them things for?’ axed the first
planter, in the Spanish lingo.</p>

<p>“‘Them’s skimmers,’ says Cap’n Roebuck,
knowin’ it warn’t no manner o’ use to try to explain
the exact truth to a man what ain’t never
seed snow, or knowed there was a zero mark on
the almanack.</p>

<p>“He grabbed up one o’ them warmin’ pans and
made a swing with it like you’d use a crab-net.
‘See! See!’ says the dons. ‘Skim-a da merlasses.’
That’s Spanish for ‘Yes, yes! skim the
merlasses,’” explained Kuk, seriously.</p>

<p>“‘But what’s the cover for?’ axed the don.
‘Ye don’t hafter have no cover,’ says Cap’n Roebuck,
and he yanks the cover off the warmin’ pan
an’ throws it away.</p>

<p>“And there them dons had the finest merlasses
dipper that ever went inter the islan’s. Cap’n
Roebuck seen their eyes snap an’ put a good, stiff
price on the things, and inside of a week there
warn’t a warmin’ pan left on the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i>.</p>

<p>“Then,” pursued the clam digger, “we stowed
away in our upper holt goods what would bring
a fancy price at Rio, and laid our course for the
Amazon.</p>

<p>“But we was all hands mighty worritted,” admitted
Kuk, lowering his voice mysteriously.
“Ye see, ye never could tell in them old days, an’
in the West Injies, who it was safe to trust, an’
who it was safe ter <i>dis</i>-trust.</p>

<p>“Yer see, so many of them snaky Spanish
planters was hand an’ glove with the pi-<i>rats</i>.
And ev’rybody on the island knowed the <i>Spankin’
Sal</i> was takin’ away a great treasure that had been
exchanged for them warmin’ pans. We was a
fair mark, as ye might say, for them pi-<i>rats</i>.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dot, hugging her Alice-doll the
tighter.</p>

<p>“How much treasure was there, Mr. Kuk?”
asked the ever-practical Tess.</p>

<p>“A chist full,” announced the clam digger without
a moment’s hesitation. “A reg’lar treasure-chist
full. All them planters hadn’t had ready
cash money to pay for the warmin’ pans, and
they’d give in exchange di’monds and other jools—and
the exchange rates for American money was
high anyway. So the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i> was a mighty
good ketch if the pi-<i>rats</i> ketched her.</p>

<p>“So, when we sailed from Porto Rico we kep’ a
weather eye open for black-painted schooners with
rakin’ masts an’ skulls and shinbones on their
flags. When we seed them signs we’d know they
was pi-<i>rats</i>,” declared Kuk, gravely.</p>

<p>The small Corner House girls sighed in unison—and
in delight! “The plot thickens!” whispered
Agnes to Ruth behind the flap of the tent
where they were listening, likewise, though unbeknown
to Kuk and the children.</p>

<p>“Go on, please, Mr. Kuk,” breathed Tess.</p>

<p>“Oh, do!” said Dot.</p>

<p>“Well, shipmets,” said the old clam digger,
“bein’ peaceful merchantmen, as ye might say, we
hadn’t shipped aboard the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i> to fight no
pi-<i>rats</i>,” declared Kuk, with energy. “We wasn’t
no sogers, and we told the skipper so.</p>

<p>“‘We’ll fight,’ says I. Bein’ an officer—carpenter’s
mate, as I told ye—I was spokesman for
the crew. ‘But we wants ter fight with weepons
as we air fermiliar with. Let you and the ossifers
fire the cannon, skipper,’ says I, ‘and give us
fellers that was bred along shore an’ on the farms
some o’ them scythes out’n the lower holt.</p>

<p>“‘Cutlasses an’ muskets,’ says I, ‘is all right
for them as has been brought up with ’em,’ says I,
‘but, skipper, me an’ my shipmets has been better
used ter cuttin’ swamp-grass an’ mowin’ oats.
Give us the weepons we air fermiliar with.’</p>

<p>“And he done it,” declared Kuk, wagging his
sinful old head. “We broke out some cases of
scythes and fixed ’em onto their handles after
grindin’ of ’em sharp as razers on the grin’stone
in the waist of the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i>.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon we seen one o’ them black-hulled
schooners comin’. She couldn’t be mistook for
anythin’ but a pi-<i>rat</i>, although she didn’t fly no
black flag yet.</p>

<p>“‘Let ’em come to close quarters, skipper,’ says
I. ‘Let ’em board us. Then me an’ my shipmets
can git ’em on the short laig. We’ll mow ’em
down like weeds along a roadside ditch.’</p>

<p>“He done it, an’ we did,” pursued Kuk, rather
heated now with the interest of his own narrative.
“When they run their schooner alongside of us
and the two ships clinched, and they broke out the
black flag at their peak, me an’ my shipmets stood
there ready to repel boarders.</p>

<p>“Them pi-<i>rats</i>,” proceeded Kuk, “fought like
a passel of cats—tooth an’ nail! They come over
aour bulwarks jest like peas pourin’ out o’ a sack.
‘Steady, lads!’ I sings out. ‘Take a long, sweepin’
stroke, an’ each o’ ye cut a good swath!’</p>

<p>“An’ we done so,” the clam digger said, nodding.
“Our scythes was longer than the cutlasses
of them pi-<i>rats</i>; and before they could git at us,
we’d reach ’em with a side-swipe of the scythes,
and mow ’em down like ripe hay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, me!” gasped Dot.</p>

<p>“How awful!” murmured Tess.</p>

<p>“’Twas sartain sure a bloody field of battle,”
declared the clam digger, nodding again. “If it
hadn’t been for my leg I wouldn’t never have
fought no pi-<i>rats</i> again. A man has his feelin’s,
ye see. Our scuppers run blood. The enemy was
piled along the deck under our bulwarks in a reg’lar
windrow.”</p>

<p>“And did you kill them <i>all</i>—every one?” demanded
Tess, in amazement.</p>

<p>“No. We jest cut ’em down for the most part,”
explained Kuk. “Ye see, we cut a low swath with
our scythes; mostly we mowed off their feet and
mebbe their legs purty near to their knees. After
that there battle there was a most awful lot o’
wooden legged pi-<i>rats</i> on the Spanish Main.</p>

<p>“An’ <i>that</i>,” declared the clam digger, rising and
getting ready to move on, “was the main reason
why I left the sea; leastwise I never wanted to go
sailin’ much in them parts again.</p>

<p>“In the scrimmage I got a shot in this leg as
busted my knee-cap. I kep’ hoppin’ ’round on
that busted leg as long as there was any pi-<i>rats</i>
to mow down; and I did the knee a lot of harm the
doctors in the horspital said.</p>

<p>“So I had ter have the leg ampertated. That
made folks down that-a-way ax me was I a pi-<i>rat</i>,
too. I’m a sensitive man,” said Kuk, wagging
his head, “an’ it hurt my feelin’s to be classed in
with all them wooden-legged fellers as we mowed
down in the <i>Spankin’ Sal</i>. So I come hum an’ left
the sea for good and all,” concluded Habakuk
Somes, and at once pegged off with his clam basket
on his arm.</p>

<p>“What an awful, <i>awful</i> story!” cried Dot.</p>

<p>“Too awful to believe,” answered Tess, wisely.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink23'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIII—THE SHADOW</a></h2>

<p>The four Corner House girls planned to start
for town one morning early, and they were going
by road instead of by boat.</p>

<p>Agnes ran over to the boys’ tents to ask Neale
O’Neil to see that their fresh fish was put upon
the ice in the icebox when the fishman came;
and she found Neale doing duty on the housekeeping
staff that morning, being busily engaged in
shaking up the pillows and beating mattresses in
the sun. The latter exertion was particularly for
the dislodgment of the ubiquitous sandflea!</p>

<p>“Hello, Ag! What’s the good word?” cried
Neale.</p>

<p>Agnes told him what they were going to do and
asked the favor.</p>

<p>“I’ll see that you get the fish all right,” Neale
agreed. “But what about the iceman? He’ll
never come near your tent with Tom Jonah there.”</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah is going with us,” Agnes said,
promptly. “Did you suppose we’d leave him all
day alone, poor fellow?”</p>

<p>When they started Tom Jonah showed his delight
at being included in the girls’ outing by the
most extravagant gyrations. As they went up the
shaded lane toward the auto-stage road, he chased
half a dozen imaginary rabbits into the woods in as
many minutes.</p>

<p>It was right at the head of the lane that they
met the man. He was not a bad looking man at
all, and he was driving a nice horse to a rubber-tired
runabout.</p>

<p>He drew in the horse, that seemed to have already
traveled some miles that morning, and
looked hard at Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, cheerfully, “there’s the old
tramp himself. How long have you girls had
him?”</p>

<p>The four Corner House girls stood stock-still,
and even Ruth was smitten dumb for the moment.</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah, you rascal!” said the man, not
unkindly. “Don’t you know your old master?”</p>

<p>At first the dog had not seen him; but the moment
he heard the man’s voice, he halted and his
whole body stiffened. The plume of his tail began
to wave; his jaws stretched wide in a doggish
smile. Then, as the man playfully snapped the
whip at him, Tom Jonah barked loudly.</p>

<p>“Where did you get him!” the man repeated,
looking at the Corner House girls again.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were clinging to each other’s
hands. Agnes stared at the man belligerently.
Ruth said—and her voice was not quite steady:</p>

<p>“Do you think you know Tom Jonah, sir?”</p>

<p>“What do you think yourself, Miss?” responded
the man, rather gruffly. “I guess there’s no mistake
about whether he knows me and I know him.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” said Ruth, bravely. “But lots of
people may know him.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to put in a claim for the dog?”
interrupted the man, quickly.</p>

<p>“Tom Jonah came to our house in Milton,” began
Ruth, when again the man interrupted with:</p>

<p>“Of course. He was on his way home to me.
I sold him to a man who lives forty miles beyond
Milton.”</p>

<p>“Then you do <i>not</i> own him?” Ruth said, with a
feeling of relief.</p>

<p>The man looked at her steadily for a minute.
Ruth had recovered her self-possession. Tess and
Dot were now on either side of Tom Jonah, with
their arms about the dog’s neck. Agnes was very
angry, but remained silent.</p>

<p>“I raised that dog from a pup, Miss. I owned
his mother. I raised him. I put his name on his
collar. He has it there yet, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” admitted Ruth.</p>

<p>“He’s always been a good dog. He’s a gentleman
if ever a dog was! He had the run of the
house. My wife and the girls made a great pet
of him. But by and by they said he was too big
and clumsy for the house. They have a couple of
little <i>fice</i>—lap-poodles, or the like. Tom Jonah
was put out, and he got jealous. Yes, sir!” and
the man laughed. “Just as jealous as a human.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Agnes. She <i>disliked</i> that man!</p>

<p>“My name’s Reynolds,” said the man. “Everybody
knows me about Shawmit. I run a lumber-yard
there.</p>

<p>“Well! Tom Jonah got to running away to
the neighbors. Stayed a while with one, then with
another. Always liked kids, Tom Jonah did, and
he’d stay longest where there were kids in the
family.</p>

<p>“But it got to be a nuisance. I didn’t know
whether the dog belonged to me or somebody else.
So I sold him to a relative of my wife’s who came
on visiting us, and took a fancy to Tom Jonah, and
who lives—as I said—forty miles beyond Milton.
So the old fellow was on his way back home when
you took him in, eh?”</p>

<p>“He came to us at Milton,” Ruth replied. “He
wanted to stay. I brought him down here to take
care of my little sisters. We’re living in a tent
down on the shore yonder——”</p>

<p>“And we’re going to keep him!” interrupted
Agnes, angrily.</p>

<p>“Hush! Be still, Aggie!” begged Ruth, in a
low tone.</p>

<p>“You don’t claim you bought him, I suppose?”
said the man who called himself Reynolds.</p>

<p>“But we <i>will</i>!” cried Ruth, instantly. “We
will gladly pay for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s not for sale again,” laughed the man.
“I sold him once and he wouldn’t stay sold, you
see.”</p>

<p>“Then he doesn’t belong to you now, any more
than he does to us, really,” Ruth hastened to say.</p>

<p>“Well——that’s so, I suppose,” admitted the
man.</p>

<p>“We won’t give Tom Jonah up to anybody,”
said Agnes again.</p>

<p>Dot was crying and Tess could scarcely keep
from following her lead. Tom Jonah stood solemnly,
his eyes very bright, his tail waving slowly.
He looked from the girls to the man in the runabout,
and back again. He knew they were discussing
him; but he did not know just what it was
all about.</p>

<p>“If we have to,” said Ruth, with much more
confidence in her voice than she felt in her heart,
“we will give Tom Jonah up to the person who
really owns him. We do not know you, sir. We
do not know if what you say is true. You must
prove it.”</p>

<p>“Well! I like that!” said the man in a tone
that showed he did not like it at all. “You are a
pretty pert young lady, you are. I guess I’ll take
my own dog home. I heard he was over here to
the beach and I drove over particularly to get
him.”</p>

<p>“Take him, then!” exclaimed Ruth, desperately.
“If Tom Jonah will go with you, all right. You
call him.”</p>

<p>“Come here, boy!” commanded the man.</p>

<p>Tom Jonah did not move. Ruth took a hand
of each of the smaller girls and led them away
from the big dog.</p>

<p>“Come, children,” she said. “We’ll go on. If
Tom Jonah really loves us, he’ll come, too.”</p>

<p>The dog whined. He looked from the red-faced,
angry man to the four girls who loved him so well.</p>

<p>“Come here, Tom Jonah!” commanded the man
again. He had turned his horse and was evidently
headed for home. “Come, sir!”</p>

<p>The Corner House girls were moving sadly
away. Agnes glanced back and actually made a
face at the man in the runabout. Fortunately he
did not see it.</p>

<p>“Come on, Tom Jonah!” said the man for the
third time.</p>

<p>The dog was perplexed. He showed it plainly.
He started after the man; he started back for the
girls. He whined and he barked. He was torn
by the conflicting emotions in his doggish soul.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” exclaimed the
man, and snapped his whiplash at Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>At that, Dot uttered a shriek of anguish. Tess
burst into tears. Agnes started back as though
to protect the dog. Even Ruth could not forbear
to utter a cry.</p>

<p>“Here, Tom Jonah! here, sir!” Agnes shouted.
“Come on, you dear old fellow.”</p>

<p>The dog barked, circled the moving carriage
once, and then raced down the road toward the
Corner House girls. The man shouted and
snapped his whip. Tom Jonah did not even look
back at him when he caught up with the girls.</p>

<div style='text-align:center'>
<img id='ilink04' src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt=''/>
<p class='caption'>The dog was perplexed. He started after the man; started back for the girls. He whined and he barked.</p>
</div>

<p>“Hurry up! let’s run with him, Ruthie,” begged
Agnes.</p>

<p>But there was no need of that. The man did not
turn his horse and follow. He was quickly out of
sight and Tom Jonah gave no sign of wishing to
follow his old master.</p>

<p>The incident troubled the Corner House girls
vastly. Even Ruth was devoted to the good old
dog by this time. If he were taken away by this
Mr. Reynolds, it would be like losing one of the
Corner House family.</p>

<p>Ruth feared that Mr. Reynolds would find some
legal way of getting possession of Tom Jonah.
She wished Mr. Howbridge were here to advise
them what to do. She even wished now that she
had not brought Tom Jonah to Pleasant Cove to
act as their “chaperon.”</p>

<p>The smaller girls dried their eyes after a time.
Agnes, “breathing threatenings,” as Ruth said,
promised Tess and Dot that the man never should
take Tom Jonah away. But Ruth wondered what
they would do about it if Mr. Reynolds came to
Willowbend Camp with a police constable and a
warrant for the dog?</p>

<p>And, too, who had sent Mr. Reynolds word that
Tom Jonah was at the beach? He particularly
said that he had been informed of the fact. It
seemed to Ruth that the informer must be their
enemy.</p>

<p>Then, out of a dust cloud that had been drawing
near the Corner House girls for some few moments,
appeared the forefront of a big touring
car. In it were Trix Severn and some of her
friends from the Overlook House.</p>

<p>“Oh! there’s Trix!” murmured Agnes to her
older sister.</p>

<p>The hotel-keeper’s daughter would not look at
the Corner House girls. She, certainly, had
proved herself their enemy. Ruth wondered if
Trix had had anything to do with bringing Mr.
Reynolds to Pleasant Cove, searching for his dog.</p>

<p>Ruth knew that the hotel-keeper’s daughter often
rode over to Shawmit; she was probably on
her way there now with her party. And after the
way Trix had acted at the time the Spoondrift
bungalow was burned, one might expect anything
mean of Trix. For once Ruth allowed her suspicions
to color her thoughts.</p>

<p>“She has awfully good times, just the same,”
murmured Agnes.</p>

<p>“Who does?” demanded Ruth, tartly.</p>

<p>“Trix.”</p>

<p>“I declare!” exclaimed Ruth, with more vexation
than she usually displayed. “I’d be ashamed
that I ever knew her after the way she’s acted.
And I believe, Agnes, that we can thank her for
setting that man after Tom Jonah.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ruth! Do you believe so?”</p>

<p>“I do,” said the older Corner House girl, and
she explained why she thought so.</p>

<p>Mr. Severn bought many of his supplies in
Shawmit, and Trix was forever running over there
in the car. It did not strain one’s imagination
very much to picture Trix hearing about Mr.
Reynolds’ dog and recognizing Tom Jonah from
the description. Besides, the Severns had been
coming to Pleasant Cove for several seasons, and
Trix might easily have seen the dog when he lived
with his first master.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” sighed Agnes. “It does seem
too bad that one’s very <i>best</i> friends sometimes
turn out to be one’s enemies. Who’d have
thought Trix Severn would do such a thing?”</p>

<p>“Of course, we don’t <i>know</i>,” admitted Ruth,
trying to be fair. “But who else could have told
Mr. Reynolds about Tom Jonah?”</p>

<p>Ruth went into the first store in the village that
sold such things and bought a new leash. This
she snapped into the ring of his collar and made
the old dog walk beside them more decorously.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot could scarcely keep from hugging
him all the time; they wanted Ruth to agree to
take the very next train back to Milton, for they
thought with the dog once at the old Corner
House, nobody could take him away from them.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like that man at all, anyway,” Tess
declared. “He had red whiskers.”</p>

<p>“Is—is that a sign that a man’s real mean if he
has red whiskers, Tess?” asked Dot, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“It’s a sign Tess doesn’t like him,” laughed
Agnes. “But I don’t like that Reynolds man
myself. Do you, Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“We’re all agreed on that point I should hope,”
said Ruth. “But we won’t run away with Tom
Jonah. If that man comes for him again, I’ll find
some way to circumvent him. The good old dog
belongs to us, if he does to anybody. And as long
as he wants to live with us, he shall. So now!”</p>

<p>The other Corner House girls finally forgot
their worriment about Tom Jonah. Ruth
warned them not to talk about it to the girls they
met. They did their errands in the village and
then went on to Spoondrift bungalow where they
spent a very enjoyable day.</p>

<p>Neale O’Neil and Joe Eldred came after supper
to escort the Corner House girls back to Willowbend
Camp. Tess and Dot had taken a nap during
the afternoon, so were not a drag on the procession,
going home.</p>

<p>They went around by the home of the little old
woman who lived in the shoe. Ruth and Agnes
had been talking with the boys about the mystery
of the strange girl who had shared in the adventures
of Tess and Dot on Wild Goose Island.
They all agreed she must be a Gypsy; but Ruth
had kept to herself the knowledge of the girl’s
identity as the Gypsy “queen.”</p>

<p>“I saw several of the Gypsies about the beach
to-day,” Joe Eldred said. “That snaky, scarred-faced
fellow was one of them.”</p>

<p>“He’s the ring-leader, I believe,” Ruth hastened
to say.</p>

<p>“Can’t just see what they are after, hanging
about here,” Neale observed. “There isn’t much
to steal. Everybody’s brought just the oldest
things they own down here to the beach.”</p>

<p>“And there are no hens to steal,” chuckled
Agnes.</p>

<p>“I bet none of them will come near the tents
while Tom Jonah is on guard,” Neale added, snapping
his fingers for the dog who was running
ahead in the moonlit path.</p>

<p>Suddenly Tom Jonah stopped and growled.
They had arrived in sight of the queer little cottage
where Rosa Wildwood lived with Mrs. Bobster.
The young folk could even see the drawn
shade of the sitting-room window.</p>

<p>“There’s that man again!” exclaimed Agnes.</p>

<p>“What man?” Joe Eldred asked.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Bobster’s mysterious friend,” giggled
Agnes. “See his shadow on the curtain?”</p>

<p>“And he’s sitting there with his hat on,” murmured
Neale.</p>

<p>But it was Ruth who saw the other—and more
important—shadow. This was the figure of a tall
man slipping along the outer side of Mrs. Bobster’s
picket fence. It was <i>this</i> shadow at which
Tom Jonah was growling.</p>

<p>The man came to the gate, opened it softly, and
stole in. His furtive movements gave the big dog
his cue. He leaped forward, barking vociferously,
leaped the fence, and followed the running figure
around the corner of the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bobster shrieked—the young folk outside
could hear her. But her “company” did not
move. He still sat there with his derby hat on.</p>

<p>The boys started after the dog. The girls stood,
clinging to one another’s hands, at the corner of
the fence.</p>

<p>From around the house appeared another running
figure; but this was a girl. She flung herself
headlong over the fence, and her skirt caught on a
picket. Ruth ran forward to release her.</p>

<p>“Oh, my dear!” she gasped. “Where did you
come from?”</p>

<p>It was the girl she had first noticed in the train
with the Gypsy woman—the very girl who had
been on Wild Goose Island with Tess and Dot. It
was she who had masqueraded as Zaliska, the
Gypsy queen.</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink24'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXIV—BROUGHT TO BOOK</a></h2>

<p>“Let me go! Let me go!” gasped the girl in
Ruth’s arms. “He will get me.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll get you?” demanded the wondering
Agnes.</p>

<p>“Big Jim, the Gypsy. He’s after me,” said the
strange girl.</p>

<p>“And Tom Jonah and the boys are after <i>him</i>,”
declared Ruth. “Don’t you fret; Big Jim won’t
come back here.”</p>

<p>“Who <i>is</i> she, Ruth?” asked Agnes.</p>

<p>“Never mind who I am,” said the girl, rather
sharply. “Let me go.”</p>

<p>“I know why you were lurking about here,”
Ruth said, calmly. “You heard that Rosa Wildwood
is stopping here.”</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded the other.</p>

<p>“Then you are June Wildwood. You’re her sister.
I don’t know how you came to be with those
Gypsies, and masquerading as an old woman——”</p>

<p>“My goodness!” gasped Agnes. “Was <i>she</i>
that Gypsy queen?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Ruth said, confidently. “Now, weren’t
you?” to the strange girl. “And aren’t you
Rosa’s sister who ran away two years ago?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am! I am!” groaned the girl.</p>

<p>“Well, Rosa’s just crazy to see you. And your
father has been searching for you everywhere,”
said Ruth, quickly. “You must come in and see
Rosa. There’s Mrs. Bobster opening the front
door.”</p>

<p>The shadow of the man with the derby hat on
his head still was motionless upon the shade; but
the widow had opened the front door on its chain,
and now demanded:</p>

<p>“Who’s there? what do you want?”</p>

<p>“It’s only me, Mrs. Bobster,” cried Ruth.</p>

<p>Tess and Dot were already running toward the
cottage door. “Oh, Mrs. Bobster!” Tess cried,
“here’s the girl that helped us on the island—me
and Dot.”</p>

<p>“And my Alice-doll,” concluded Dot, likewise
excited. “And Ruthie says she’s Rosa’s sister.”</p>

<p>“For the good land of liberty’s sake!” ejaculated
Mrs. Bobster, throwing wide the door.
“Come in! Come in!”</p>

<p>The girl whom Ruth had seized hesitated for a
moment. Ruth whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>“Rosa is wearing her heart out for you, June
Wildwood. And your father isn’t drinking any
more. He has a steady job. You come back to
them and you needn’t be afraid of those Gypsies.”</p>

<p>“They’ll try to get me back. Doc. Raynes’ wife
was one of them. The old doctor died a year ago,
and since then I’ve been with that gang,” said
June Wildwood.</p>

<p>“Were the doctor and his wife the folks you ran
away with?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I danced and sang and dressed up in
character to help entertain their audiences when
he sold bitters and salve,” the girl explained.
“The old doctor treated me all right. But these
thieving Gypsies are different. Mrs. Doc. Raynes
is Big Jim’s sister.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you be afraid of them any more. We’ll
set the police after them,” Ruth declared.
“Where have you been since the day my sisters
were with you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been washing dishes at a hotel here in
Pleasant Cove. But I kept under cover. I was
afraid of them,” said the girl.</p>

<p>They reached the door then, and went into the
cottage. Mrs. Bobster ushered them right into
the sitting-room and at once all the girls halted in
amazement. There was an armchair standing between
the window and the center table, where the
lamp sat. Leaning against the chair was the
broom, and on the business end of that very useful
household implement was a hat that had probably
once belonged to the husband of the little old
woman who lived in a shoe.</p>

<p>“My goodness sake!” ejaculated Agnes, the
first to get her breath. “Then it was not company
you had at all, Mrs. Bobster?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the widow, in a business-like way,
removing the hat from the broom and standing the
latter in the corner. “But I didn’t want folks to
know it. There’s some stragglers around here
after dark, and I wanted ’em to think there was a
man in the house.”</p>

<p>At that moment Rosa Wildwood came running
downstairs in wrapper and slippers. “I heard
her! I heard her!” she shrieked, and the next
moment the two sisters were hugging each other
frantically.</p>

<p>Explanations were in order; and it took some
time for the little old lady who lived in a shoe to
understand the reunion of her boarder and the girl
who had lived with the Gypsies.</p>

<p>The boys and Tom Jonah came back, having
chased the lurking Big Jim for quite a mile
through the woods. “And Tom Jonah brought
back a piece of his coat-tail,” chuckled Neale
O’Neil. “He can consider himself lucky that the
dog didn’t bite deeper!”</p>

<p>“I guess that dog doesn’t like Gypsies,” said
June Wildwood, patting Tom Jonah’s head.</p>

<p>The boys were just as much interested as their
girl friends in the reunion of Rosa and her sister.
Meanwhile Mrs. Bobster bustled about and found
the usual pitcher of cool milk and a great platter
of cookies. The young folk feasted beyond reason
while they all talked.</p>

<p>Ruth arranged with the little old woman who
lived in a shoe to let June stay with her sister, and
she promised June, as well, that if she would return
to Milton with Rosa, employment would be
found for her so that she could be self-supporting,
yet live at home with Rosa and Bob Wildwood.</p>

<p>The Corner House girls offered to leave Tom
Jonah to guard the premises for that night. But
Mrs. Bobster said:</p>

<p>“I reckon I won’t be scaret none with two great
girls in the house with me. Besides, when I am
asleep, being lonesome don’t bother me none—no,
ma’am!”</p>

<p>“Well, we don’t know how long we’re going to
have old Tom Jonah ourselves,” sighed Agnes, as
the party bound for the tent colony started on
again.</p>

<p>“How’s that!” demanded Neale, quickly.</p>

<p>They told him about the man named Reynolds,
from Shawmit, and the claim he had made to the
big dog. Neale was equally troubled with the Corner
House girls over this, and he advised Ruth and
Agnes to take the dog wherever they went.</p>

<p>“Don’t give the fellow a chance to find Tom
Jonah alone, or with the little girls,” said Neale.
“I don’t believe he can get the dog legally without
considerable trouble. And Tom Jonah has shown
whom he likes best.”</p>

<p>This uncertainty about Tom Jonah, however,
did not keep the Corner House girls from continuing
their good times at Pleasant Cove. With
one of the ladies of the tent colony for chaperon
the girls and their boy friends had many a “junket”—up
the river, down the bay, and even outside
upon the open sea.</p>

<p>It was on one of these latter occasions that
Ruth and Agnes joined Neale and his friends on
the “double-ender,” <i>Hattie G.</i>, and with her crew
spent a night and a day chasing the elusive swordfish.</p>

<p>That <i>was</i> an adventure; and one not soon to be
forgotten by the older Corner House girls. Of
course Tess and Dot were too small to go on this
trip and they were fast asleep in one of the neighboring
tents when Neale O’Neil came and
scratched on the canvas of that in which Ruth and
Agnes slept.</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Agnes. “What’s that!”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Neale?” demanded Ruth, calmly.</p>

<p>“Of course. Get a bustle on,” advised the boy.
“The motorboat will be ready in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” ejaculated Agnes, giggling. “You
know we don’t wear bustles, Neale. They are too
old-fashioned for anything.”</p>

<p>She and Ruth quickly dressed. There wasn’t
much “prinking and preening” before the mirror
on this morning, that was sure. In ten minutes
the two Corner House girls were running down
the beach, with their bags (packed over-night) and
their rain-coats over their arms. Tom Jonah
raced after them.</p>

<p>Everywhere save on the beach itself the shadows
lay deep. There was no moon and the stars
twinkled high overhead—spangles sewed on the
black-velvet robe of Night.</p>

<p>Out upon the quietly heaving waters sounded
voices—then the pop of a launch engine.</p>

<p>“Come on!” urged Neale’s voice. “They’re
getting the boat ready, girls.”</p>

<p>“But we’re not going out to the banks in the
<i>Nimble Shanks</i>—surely!” cried Agnes.</p>

<p>“No. But we’re going down the cove in her to
catch the <i>Hattie G.</i> Skipper Joline sent up a
rocket for us half an hour ago. The tide’s going
out. He won’t wait long, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“It would be lots more comfortable to go all the
way in the motorboat—wouldn’t it?” asked Ruth,
stepping into the skiff after Agnes and the dog.</p>

<p>“Skipper Joline would have a fit,” laughed Joe
Eldred. “A motorboat engine would scare every
swordfish within a league of the Banks—so <i>he</i>
says. He declares <i>that</i> is what makes them so
hard to catch the last few seasons. These motorboats
running about the sea are a greater nuisance
than the motor cars ashore—so he declares.”</p>

<p>“I suppose the swordfish shy at the motorboats
just like the horses shy at automobiles!” giggled
Agnes, as Neale and Joe pushed off and seized the
oars.</p>

<p>“Yep,” grunted Neale O’Neil. “And the motorboats
have frightened all the horse-mackerel
away. That’s a joke. I’ll tell the Skipper <i>that</i>.”</p>

<p>Several shadowy figures—being those of the
other boys and Mr. and Mrs. Stryver, who were
members of the swordfishing party, too—were
spied about the deck and cockpit of the <i>Nimble
Shanks</i>. The boys shot the skiff in beside the
motorboat and helped the girls aboard. Then
they moored the skiff to the motorboat’s buoy and
soon the <i>Nimble Shanks</i> was away, down the cove.</p>

<p>It was past two o’clock—the darkest minutes of
a summer’s morning. Seaward, a light haze hung
over the water—seemingly a veil of mist let down
from the sky to shut out the view of all distant
objects from the out-sailing mariners.</p>

<p>As the party neared the fishing fleet, voices carried
flatly across the water, and now and then a
dog barked. Tom Jonah answered these canines
ashore with explosive growls. He stood forward,
his paws planted firmly on the deck, and snuffing
the sea air. Tom Jonah was a good sailor.</p>

<p>“Got your scare?” a voice came out of the darkness,
quavering across the cove. “Going to be
thick outside.”</p>

<p>Neale grabbed the fish-horn and blew a mighty
blast on it. Similar horns answered from all
about the fleet.</p>

<p>A towering mast, with its big sail bending to the
breeze, shot past them—the big cat-boat, <i>Susie</i>,
bound for her lines of lobster-pots just off the
mouth of the cove. Her crew hailed the launch
and her party—four sturdy young fellows in jerseys
and high sea-boots.</p>

<p>“Whew!” said Joe. “Smell that lobster bait!
I’d hate to go for a pleasure trip on the <i>Susie</i>.”</p>

<p>The <i>Hattie G.</i> was just ahead and Mr. Stryver
shut off the engine. The drab, dirty looking old
craft tugged sharply at her taut mooring cable.
She had two short masts, and on these heavy canvas
was being spread by the crew, which consisted
of five men and a boy.</p>

<p>One of the men was the skipper, another the
mate, a third the cook; but all hands had to turn
to to make sail. There were several sweeps
(heavy oars) held in bights of rope along the rail.
Both ends of the <i>Hattie G.</i> were sharp; in other
words she had two bows. Thus the name, “double-ender”—a
build of craft now almost extinct
save in a few New England ports out of which ply
the swordfishermen.</p>

<p>Skipper Joline came to the rail. He was a
hoarse, red-faced man with a white beard, cut like
a paintbrush, on his chin.</p>

<p>“Climb aboard, folks,” he said. “Steve will
get breakfast shortly. There’s a bit of fog and
some swell outside. Better all lay in a good
foundation of scouse and sody biscuit. Ye’ll need
it later.”</p>

<p>“That sounds rather suggestive, Ruth,” whispered
Agnes. “Do you suppose he expects us
landlubbers to be really <i>sick</i>?”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” replied her sister. “But I don’t
care! I’m going to eat that breakfast if it kills
me! I was never so hungry in all my life before.”</p>

<p>They left the <i>Nimble Shanks</i> moored at the double-ender’s
anchor-buoy, and the latter lurched
away on the short leg of her tack for the entrance
to the cove. There was a fresh breeze and the
water began to sing under the sharp bows of the
<i>Hattie G.</i></p>

<p>The cook got busy in the galley and the fragrance
of coffee and fried fish smothered all
other smells about the craft—for it must be confessed
that the double-ender had an ancient and
fishy smell of her own that was not altogether
pleasant to the nostrils of a fastidious person.</p>

<p>These hearty boys and girls were out for fun,
however, and they had been long enough at Pleasant
Cove to get used to most fishy odors. Before
breakfast was over the <i>Hattie G.</i> had run through
the “Breach,” as the cove entrance was called,
and they were sailing straight out to sea.</p>

<p>The mournful wail of a horn in the fog now and
then announced the location of some lobsterman.
The <i>Hattie G.</i> answered these “scares” with her
own horn and swept on through the fog.</p>

<p>But now the mist began to lift. A golden glow
rose, increased, and spread all along the eastern
horizon. Suddenly they shot out of the fog and
sailed right into the bright path of the rising sun.</p>

<p>This wonderful sight of sunrise at sea delighted
Ruth and Agnes intensely. It was just as
though they had sailed suddenly into a new world.</p>

<p>The fog masked the land astern. Ahead was
nothing but the heaving, greenish-gray waves,
foam-streaked at their crowns to the distant skyline,
with only a few sails crossing the line of
vision. Not a speck of land marred the seascape.</p>

<p>Later, when the <i>Hattie G.</i> reached the Banks,
there was something beside the view to interest
and excite the Corner House girls.</p>

<p>The big sails were lowered and only a riding
sail spread to keep the <i>Hattie G.</i> on an even keel.
A “pulpit” was set up on each of her short booms—both
fore and aft.</p>

<p>At the top of a mast was rigged a barrel-like
thing in which the lookout stood with a glass, on
the watch for the swordfish.</p>

<p>These can only be caught asleep on the surface
of the sea. When one is sighted either the sails
are hoisted, or the sweeps are used, to bring the
vessel near enough for the skipper or his mate to
make a cast of the harpoon.</p>

<p>Once one of the huge fish was spied, everybody
aboard the <i>Hattie G.</i> was on the <i>qui vive</i>. The
boys climbed the ratlines to see. The girls borrowed
the cook’s old-fashioned spyglass to get a
better view of the creature.</p>

<p>The <i>Hattie G.</i> was brought softly near the fish.
Skipper Joline had warned his guests to keep
quiet. Ruth kept her hand upon Tom Jonah’s collar
so that he should not disturb the proceedings.</p>

<p>The skipper stepped into the pulpit—a framework
of iron against which he leaned when he cast
the harpoon. All was ready for the supreme moment.</p>

<p>The coil of the line was laid behind him. The
crew brought the <i>Hattie G.</i> just to the spot Skipper
Joline indicated with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>Back swung the mighty arm of the skipper, the
muscles swelling like cables under the sleeve of
his blue jersey.</p>

<p>“Now!” breathed the mate, as eager as any of
the boys or girls among the spectators.</p>

<p>Ping!</p>

<p>The skipper had let drive. The harpoon sank
deeply into the fish. For a brief instant they saw
blood spurt out and dye the sea.</p>

<p>Then the huge fish leaped almost its length from
the sea. The crew drove the <i>Hattie G.</i> back.
Good reason why the swordfishing craft are built
sharp at both ends!</p>

<p>How the fish thrashed and fought! Its sword
beat the water to foam. Had it found the double-ender,
the latter’s bottom-planks would have been
no protection against the creature’s blows.</p>

<p>A swordfish has been known to thrust its weapon
through the bottom of a boat and break it off in its
struggles to get free.</p>

<p>“Oh, Agnes!” gasped Ruth, when the fight was
over and the huge fish killed. “Who would ever
believe, while buying a slice of swordfish, that it
was so dangerous to capture one of the creatures?”</p>

<p>The crew of the <i>Hattie G.</i> got four ere they set
sail for Pleasant Cove again, and the Corner
House girls became quite used to the methods of
the fishermen and the tactics of the swordfish on
being struck.</p>

<p>They sailed back to Pleasant Cove with what
was called the prize catch of the season. When
a fish is as big as a good-sized dining-table and
sells for twenty-five cents a pound, retail, it does
not take many to make a good catch.</p>

<p>Ruth and Agnes, and Neale and the other boys,
were glad they went on the trip. They arrived at
the camp late in the evening, filled with enthusiasm
over the adventures of the day.</p>

<p>And Skipper Joline presented the Corner House
girls with a four-foot sword which, later, occupied
a place of honor over the sitting-room mantelpiece
in the old Corner House at Milton.</p>

<p>Ruth took Tom Jonah up to see the Wildwood
girls with her the very next time she went to call.</p>

<p>The Corner House girl found Rosa and June
shelling peas under the arbor, while Mrs. Bobster
was talking with Kuk Somes over a “mess” of
clams she had bought.</p>

<p>“You ain’t honest enough to count out a hunderd
clams, Kuk,” declared the plain-spoken old
lady. “Ye got such a high-powered imagination
that ye can’t count straight.”</p>

<p>“Now, Mis’ Bobster, thet thar’s a hard statement
ter make,” said Kuk, shaking his head, but
grinning. “Don’t make me out so ’fore these here
young ladies.”</p>

<p>“I reckon they know ye!” cried the widow. “If
they’ve ever hearn ye spin one o’ yer sea-farin’
yarns——”</p>

<p>“And we have,” interposed Ruth, smiling.
“He’s told us about how he sailed in the <i>Spanking
Sal</i> and lost his leg fighting pirates.”</p>

<p>“For the good land o’ liberty!” gasped Mrs.
Bobster. “He never told ye <i>that</i>?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. It was very interesting,” laughed
Ruth.</p>

<p>“Why,” said the widow, angrily, “that fellow
never sailed in a deep-water craft in his life. The
only time he ever went out in a double-ender as
fur as the swordfish banks, he was so sick they had
ter bring him ashore on a stretcher!”</p>

<p>“Now, Mis’ Bobster——” began the clam digger,
faintly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that <i>so</i>? Ye daren’t deny it,” she declared.
“He ain’t no sailor. He’s jest an old
beach-comber. Don’t never go in <i>any</i> boat outside
of the cove. Lost his leg fightin’ pirates, did he?
Huh!”</p>

<p>“So he told us,” said the much amused Ruth.</p>

<p>“Why, th’ ridiculous old thing!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bobster, laughing herself now. “He lost
that leg in Mr. Reynolds’ sawmill at Shawmit—that’s
how he did it. And he was tipsy at the
time or he wouldn’t never have got hurt.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Ruth, staring at the sheepish clam
digger.</p>

<p>“And he goes over there to Shawmit ev’ry
month an’ collects ten dollars from Reynolds,
who’s good-natured and helps him out with a pension.
Ain’t that so, Kuk Somes!”</p>

<p>The wooden-legged clam digger nodded.
“Whar’s the harm?” he murmured. “Ye know
these city folks likes ter hear my yarns. An’ it
don’t hurt ’em none.”</p>

<p>“But that’s how Mr. Reynolds heard about our
having Tom Jonah,” declared Ruth, accusingly.
“You told him.”</p>

<p>“Yep. That’s his old dawg,” said Kuk.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve made us a lot of trouble,” said
Ruth, sadly. “For I am afraid that Mr. Reynolds
will try to take Tom Jonah away. And,” she
added, in secret, “how wrong I was to accuse Trix
Severn, without stronger evidence.”</p>

<h2 class='chapter' id='clink25'><a href='#toc'>CHAPTER XXV—THE END OF THE OUTING</a></h2>

<p>Tess and Dot Kenway had a very serious matter
to decide. Ruth had determined that, as they
were all enjoying themselves at Pleasant Cove so
much, the Corner House flag should continue to
wave for a time longer over their tent in the Willowbend
Camp.</p>

<p>But there was something at home in Milton, at
the old Corner House itself, that the younger girls
thought they <i>must</i> attend to.</p>

<p>“It’s really a <i>nawful</i> state of affairs,” Tess declared,
nodding her sunny head, gravely, and with
her lips pursed up. “They are growing right up
without knowing their own names. Why! I don’t
see how their own mother knows them apart.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” gasped Dot, to whom this was a new idea
indeed. “I never thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s so,” said Tess. “I—I wish Ruth
had sent for them and had had them brought down
here when Rosa and Tom Jonah came.”</p>

<p>“But they couldn’t leave their mother, Tess,”
objected Dot. “They’re too small.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t—know,” said Tess, doubtfully. “At
any rate, it’s high time they were named. You
know, Mrs. MacCall says so herself.”</p>

<p>Dot picked up the letter that the kind housekeeper
at the old Corner House had written especially
to the two smaller Kenway girls.</p>

<p>“She says they chase their tails all day long
and they have had to put them out in the woodshed
to keep them from being under foot,” Dot said,
reading slowly, for Mrs. MacCall’s writing was
not like print.</p>

<p>“They must be named,” repeated Tess, with
conviction.</p>

<p>“But Ruth won’t let us go home to do it,” quoth
Dot.</p>

<p>“And I don’t want to. Do <i>you</i>?” demanded
Tess, hastily. “I don’t want to leave the beach
now, just when we’re having so much fun.”</p>

<p>Neither did Dot. But the state of the unchristened
kittens—the youngest family of Sandyface—troubled
her exceedingly.</p>

<p>Tess, however, suddenly had one of her very
brilliant ideas. “I tell you what let’s do!” she
cried.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Let’s write Mrs. MacCall and Uncle Rufus a
letter, and ask them to name Sandyface’s children
their own selves.”</p>

<p>“But—but <i>we</i> want to name them,” cried Dot.</p>

<p>“Goosey!” exclaimed Tess. “We’ll choose the
names; but Mrs. MacCall and Uncle Rufus can
give them to the kittens. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Tess! we might,” agreed Dot, delighted.</p>

<p>Tess ran to the tent for paper and pencil, and
bespoke the favor of an envelope addressed in ink
to Mrs. MacCall.</p>

<p>“Of course, I’ll address one for you,” said Ruth,
kindly. “But what’s all the hurry about writing
home?”</p>

<p>Tess explained the necessity that had arisen.
Sandyface’s family of kittens was growing up
without being christened—and something might
happen to them.</p>

<p>“You know,” said Tess, gravely, “it would be
dreadful if one of them died and we didn’t know
what to put on the headboard. It would be dreadful!”</p>

<p>“And what names shall we send Mrs. MacCall?”
Dot wanted to know, when Tess had started the
letter “Deare Missus Mcall” and was chewing the
pencil as an aid to further thought.</p>

<p>“Let’s call them by seashore names,” suggested
Tess. “Then they’ll remind us of the fun we had
here at Pleasant Cove.”</p>

<p>“Oh-oo! Let’s,” agreed Dot.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Tess, promptly. “What will
be the very first one? I’ll write Mrs. MacCall
what we want,” and she proceeded to indite the
following paragraph to begin the letter:</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“We are having so much fun down here at plesent cove that we cant
find time to come home and name Sandface’s babbies. But we want
you and unc rufs to do it for us and we are going to send you the
names we chose. They are——”</p>
</div>

<p>Here Tess’s laboring pencil came to a full stop.
“Now, you got the first name, Dot?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I got two,” declared Dot, confidently.</p>

<p>“What are they!” queried Tess. “Now, we
want them to be real salt-water names. Just like
fishes’ names—or boats’ names—or like that.”</p>

<p>“I got two,” declared Dot, soberly. “Lots of
men must be named those names about here. I
hear them hollerin’ to each other when they are
out in the boats.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” cried Tess, impatiently. “What
are the names?”</p>

<p>“One’s ‘Starboard’ and the other’s ‘Port,’”
declared Dot, seriously. “And they are real nice
names, <i>I</i> think.”</p>

<p>Tess was rather taken aback. She had a hazy
opinion that “Starboard” and “Port” were not
Christian names; they <i>might</i> be, however, and she
had heard them herself a good deal. Besides, she
wanted to agree with Dot if she could, and so she
sighed and wrote as follows:</p>

<div class='bq'>
<p>“We got to names alreddy, Missus Mcall, and one’s Starborde and the
other is Port. They are very pretty names, we think and we hope you
an unc rufs and Sandface will like them, to. You give them to the
kittens that they seem to fit the best, pleas.”</p>
</div>

<p>Neale, and Ruth, and Agnes came along some
time afterward and found the smaller Corner
House girls reduced almost to a state of
distraction. They had been unable to decide upon two
more names. “Starboard” and “Port” had been
inspired, it seemed. Now they were “stuck.”</p>

<p>“It <i>does</i> seem as though there should be some
other seashore names that would sound good for
kittens,” sighed Tess. “I think ‘Starboard’ and
‘Port’ are real pretty—don’t you, Ruth?”</p>

<p>“Very fine,” agreed her older sister, while
Agnes restrained her giggles.</p>

<p>“Why not call one of the others ‘Hard-a-Lee’?”
suggested Neale, gravely.</p>

<p>“Is <i>that</i> a seashore name?” asked Tess, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Just as salt as a dried codfish,” declared
Neale, confidently.</p>

<p>“I think it is real pretty,” Dot ventured.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll call the third one ‘Hard-a-Lee,’”
declared Tess. “I’ll tell Mrs. MacCall so,” and
she laboriously went at the misspelled letter again.</p>

<p>“But how about the fourth one?” asked Agnes,
laughing. “He’s not going to be a step-child, is
he? Isn’t he to have a name?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We must have one more,” Tess said,
wearily. “Won’t <i>you</i> give us one, Aggie?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” said Agnes, promptly. “Main-sheet.’”</p>

<p>“‘Starboard, Port, Hard-a-Lee and Main-sheet.’
Some names, those!” declared Neale.</p>

<p>“I like them,” Tess said, reflectively. “They
don’t sound like other cats’ names—do they,
Ruthie?”</p>

<p>“They most certainly do not,” admitted the
oldest Corner House girl.</p>

<p>“And are they pretty, Ruthie?” asked Dot.</p>

<p>“They are better than ‘pretty,’” agreed Ruth,
kindly. “If you children are suited, I am sure
everybody else—including the kittens themselves—will
be pleased!”</p>

<p>The labored letter was therefore finished and
sent away. As Dot said, “it lifted a great load
from their minds.”</p>

<p>But there was another matter that served to
trouble all four of the Corner House girls for some
days. That was what Mr. Reynolds, the lumberman,
was going to do about Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>The girls seldom left their tent now without
taking the dog with them. He was something of a
nuisance in the boat when they went crabbing; but
Agnes would not hear of going out without him.</p>

<p>“I know that man will come back here some time
and try to get him away,” she declared. “But
Tom Jonah will never go of his own free will—no,
indeed!”</p>

<p>“And he won’t sell him again, he said,” sighed
Ruth. “I don’t just see what we can do.”</p>

<p>However, this trouble did not keep the Corner
House girls from having many good times with
their girl friends at the Spoondrift bungalow, and
their boy friends on the beach.</p>

<p>There were fishing trips, and picnics on Wild
Goose Island. They sometimes went outside the
cove in bigger boats, and fished on the “banks,”
miles and miles off shore. There was fun in the
evenings, too, at the hotel dances, although the
Corner House girls did not attend any of those
held at the Overlook House, for they were not exactly
friendly with Trix Severn.</p>

<p>One day Pearl Harrod’s Uncle Phil arranged to
take a big party of the older girls to Shawmit,
which was some miles up the river. Ruth and
Agnes went along and that day they left Tom
Jonah at Willowbend to take care of the smaller
girls.</p>

<p>Ruth determined to see Mr. Reynolds, so when
they reached Shawmit, she hunted up the lumberman’s
office. She found him in a more amiable
mood than he had been on the morning he drove
to Pleasant Cove to get Tom Jonah.</p>

<p>“Well, Miss!” he said. “How do you feel
about giving up that dog?”</p>

<p>“Just the same, sir,” said Ruth, honestly.
“But I hope you will tell me who the man is you
sold Tom Jonah to, so that we can go to him and
buy the dog.”</p>

<p>“Do you girls really want old Tom Jonah as
much as <i>that</i>?” asked Mr. Reynolds.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the girl, simply.</p>

<p>“Willing to buy the old rascal? And he’s nothing
but a tramp.”</p>

<p>“He’s a gentleman. You said so yourself on
his collar,” said Ruth.</p>

<p>The man looked at her seriously and nodded.
“I guess you think a whole lot of him, eh?”</p>

<p>“A great deal, sir,” admitted Ruth.</p>

<p>“Well! I guess I’ll have to tell you,” said the
man, smiling. “Old Tom evidently thinks more
of you girls than he does of me. Tell you what:
After I got home the other day I thought it over.
I reckon Tom Jonah’s chosen for himself. I paid
my brother-in-law back the money he gave me for
him. So you won’t be bothered again about him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir——”</p>

<p>“You keep him. Rather, let Tom Jonah stay as
long as he wants to. But if he comes back to me
I sha’n’t let him go again. No! I don’t want
money for him. I guess the old dog likes it where
he is, and his days of usefulness are pretty nearly
over anyway. I’m convinced he’ll have a good
home with you Corner House girls.”</p>

<p>“Just as long as he lives!” declared Ruth, fervently.</p>

<p>So Mr. Reynolds did not prove to be a hardhearted
man, after all. Agnes and Tess and Dot
were delighted. There was a regular celebration
over Tom Jonah that evening after Ruth got home
and told the news.</p>

<p>It is doubtful if Tom Jonah understood when
Dot informed him that he was going to be their
dog “for keeps.” But he barked very intelligently
and the two smaller girls were quite convinced
that he understood every word that was
said to him.</p>

<p>“Of course, he can’t talk back,” Tess said.
“Dogs don’t speak our language. But if we could
understand the <i>barking language</i>, I am sure we
would hear him say he was glad.”</p>

<p>And as our story of the Corner House girls’
visit to Pleasant Cove began with Tom Jonah, we
may safely end it with the assurance that the good
old dog will spend the rest of his life with Ruth
and Agnes and Tess and Dot, at the old Corner
House in Milton.</p>

<p>Mary Jane is the typical American little
girl who bubbles over with fun and the
good things in life. We meet her here on
a visit to her grandfather’s farm where she
becomes acquainted with farm life and farm
animals and thoroughly enjoys the experience.
We next see her going to
kindergarten and then on a visit to Florida, and then—but
read the stories for yourselves.</p>

<p>Exquisitely and charmingly written are these books which
every little girl from five to nine years old will want from the
first book to the last.</p>
